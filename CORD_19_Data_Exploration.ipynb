Here, we developed a rapid and simultaneous detection toolkit for influenza A H5 subtype viruses in human samples based on a bioconjugate of quantum dots (QDs) assembly and a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system (SRDFDS). Methods: Two types of QDs were assembled on a latex bead to enhance the detection sensitivity and specificity of influenza A infection (QD580) and H5 subtype (QD650). The dual signals of influenza A and H5 subtype of H5N1-infected patients were detected simultaneously and quantified separately by SRDFDS equipped with two emission filters. Results: Our results showed a high sensitivity of 92.86% (13/14) and 78.57% (11/14), and a specificity of 100% (38/38, P < 0.0001) and 97.37% (37/38) for influenza A and H5 subtype detection, respectively.

However, AI viruses may occasionally infect humans through direct or indirect contact, resulting in disease symptoms ranging from a mild illness to death. AI has become a global concern with a mortality rate of approximately 60% [2] . In this context, the H5N1 virus is highly Ivyspring International Publisher contagious among birds and can be deadly, especially in domestic poultry and humans. Therefore, an on-site surveillance/alert system for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 would prevent widespread exposure to the virus and identify potential patients/animals for immediate attention and treatment. Improved case management of diseases with common flu symptoms is especially crucial in densely populated areas [3] . An adequate H5 subtype-specific diagnostic toolkit for on-site monitoring has not been developed, and current field-level point-of-care testing (POCT) is not recommended for screening AI infections in clinical samples due to insufficient sensitivity and poor accuracy [4] . Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers using antigen-specific antibodies can increase the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of POCT.

So far, preventing nonspecific reactions in QDs and increasing solubility have been major challenges because the use of high-temperature organometallic synthetic procedures produces monodisperse nanocrystals with a passivated surface containing a monolayer of hydrophobic surfactant ligands [44] [45] [46] . QDs are insolubly monodispersed with a very wide range of possible emission spectra ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared that can be controlled by simply changing their size, composition, and structure [36, 37] . For water compatibility and bioconjugation, QDs are covered with a hydrophilic shell which is a popular method to solubilize QDs in aqueous media and improve their signal intensity through encapsulation with polymers [31, 32] . To apply QDs to POCT, encapsulation of QDs with a polymer was routinely used to amplify the fluorescent signal, and few trials have attempted to use polymers on QD surface for POCT systems [31, 32, 47] . This may reflect the weakness of the fluorescent signal of QDs making it difficult to be captured by POCT. An additional method of encapsulating many QDs in one particle was suggested to amplify the fluorescent signal from the QD nanoparticles [32] . Currently, a rapid dual POCT system has been developed that detects two different pathogen species rather than two antigen targets in one pathogen [33] .

Here, we developed a rapid and simultaneous detection toolkit for influenza A H5 subtype viruses in human samples based on a bioconjugate of quantum dots (QDs) assembly and a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system (SRDFDS). Methods: Two types of QDs were assembled on a latex bead to enhance the detection sensitivity and specificity of influenza A infection (QD580) and H5 subtype (QD650). The dual signals of influenza A and H5 subtype of H5N1-infected patients were detected simultaneously and quantified separately by SRDFDS equipped with two emission filters. Results: Our results showed a high sensitivity of 92.86% (13/14) and 78.57% (11/14), and a specificity of 100% (38/38, P < 0.0001) and 97.37% (37/38) for influenza A and H5 subtype detection, respectively. Conclusion: Therefore, our multiplex QD bioconjugates and SRDFDS-based influenza virus detection toolkit potentially provide accurate and meaningful diagnosis information with improved detection accuracies and sensitivities for H5N1 patients.'}]"

However, AI viruses may occasionally infect humans through direct or indirect contact, resulting in disease symptoms ranging from a mild illness to death. AI has become a global concern with a mortality rate of approximately 60% [2] . In this context, the H5N1 virus is highly Ivyspring International Publisher contagious among birds and can be deadly, especially in domestic poultry and humans. Therefore, an on-site surveillance/alert system for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 would prevent widespread exposure to the virus and identify potential patients/animals for immediate attention and treatment. Improved case management of diseases with common flu symptoms is especially crucial in densely populated areas [3] . An adequate H5 subtype-specific diagnostic toolkit for on-site monitoring has not been developed, and current field-level point-of-care testing (POCT) is not recommended for screening AI infections in clinical samples due to insufficient sensitivity and poor accuracy [4] . Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers using antigen-specific antibodies can increase the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of POCT. Thus, many researchers have attempted to design a molecular diagnostic method for the simultaneous detection of influenza A and B as well as their subtypes [5] [6] [7] .'},\n",

We synthesized water-soluble and stable core-multi-shell QDs (CdSe/CdS/ZnS) using the standard hot injection method with TOPO ligand as the stabilizing agent. Subsequently, ligand exchange was carried out to replace the hydrophobic TOPO ligands with hydrophilic MPA ligands. The emission wavelength could be tuned by controlling the QD core size, and two types of QDs (QD580 and QD650 at 580 nm and 650 nm emissions, respectively) were synthesized. The QYs of the QDs were calculated as 70% and 48% for QD580 and QD650, respectively (Fig. S1) . The diameters of QD580 and QD650 were 5.4 ± 1.5 nm and 9.3 ± 2.0 nm, respectively (Fig. S2) . This high QY (>70%) has been reported to be measurable under UV light [38] ; however, few studies have investigated the required QYs for a relatively low sensitivity detection tool such as POCT. When we observed the fluorescence signals of the QDs under a UV lamp after a strip assay with a high concentration of viruses (160 hemagglutinin units [HAU]/ml) (Fig. 1A) , intensities of both QD580 and QD650 conjugates were inconclusive in both the test and control lines, indicating that QDs alone are not suitable for sensitive virus detection in POCT.'},\n",

Following conjugation of the QDs with mAbs, the sizes of the complexes increased to 185.83 ± 5.25 nm for latex + QD580 + mAb, and 188.38 ± 5.28 nm for latex + QD650 + mAb, compared to the latex alone (175.09 ± 5.27 nm) (n = 30 per sample) (Fig. 1D) . This diameter of the latex was chosen because it was relatively bigger than the antibody (hydrodynamic diameter of ∼10 nm) [39] and the QDs (10 nm). Empirically, a latex larger than 175 nm caused precipitation on the membrane thereby hindering the lateral flow, and smaller than 100 nm latex could not efficiently carry the antibody and QDs on the surface. According to our computational calculations of the average diameter of the QDs, latex, and length of MPA ligands, the surface of the latex was conjugated with an average of 2,243 numbers of QD580 and 924 of QD650 beads per latex, respectively (details of this calculation are shown in Supplementary Information Scheme S1) .'},\n",

The fluorescence intensity of the two QDs bioconjugates was measured by a smartphone detector utilizing the same platform containing a pair of parabolic mirrors between the lateral flow strip and the smartphone's camera [13] . However, current SRDFDS was designed to get fluorescent signals of two QDs separately in the CL, using two different emission filters (580 nm and 650 nm) which were inserted into the module (Fig. 2B) . In the lateral flow, a control line was used to confirm completion of the testing reaction by capturing the antibody on the conjugate. Our study was performed using both conjugate mouse monoclonal antibodies. As the species of anti-influenza A NP and H5 subtype were the same, anti-mouse IgGs coated on one control line were expected to capture both conjugates. With emission filters, the fluorescent signal of each conjugate captured on the control line could be obtained, separately. The emission filter at 580 nm had 585 nm wavelength (at center) and 65 nm bandwidth, while the emission filter at 650 nm had 650 nm wavelength (at center) and 45 nm bandwidth, indicating that the two emission filters could discriminate each QD signal at one CL.\"},\n",

The RNA copy number of the LOD (10 HAU/mL) for SRDFDS was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) (Fig. S7 ). The LOD of the fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (FICT; 10 HAU/mL) corresponded to a Ct value of 27.86 ± 0.26 (mean ± SD) and 3.3 × 10 5 ± 5.2 × 10 3 (mean ± SD) RNA/µL for influenza A NP, and a Ct value of 28.27 ± 0.095 (mean ± SD) and 5.9 × 10 5 ± 3.9 × 10 3 (mean ± SD) RNA/µL for H5 HA. The accuracy of SRDFDS was examined by computing the inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ( Table 1) . The virus titer of spiked specimens was adjusted to 40 or 160 HAU/mL by mixing 10 µL of the appropriate virus stock with 90 µL of nasopharyngeal specimens. The ratios of TL/CL derived from all experiments were then plotted for comparison. TL/CL between the negative control and specimens with the virus at 40 HAU/mL or 160 HAU/mL showed a significant difference for influenza A and H5 HA at the relevant emission filter (P < 0.001). The analytical error rate was computed by the inter-assay CV based on replicates of 40 HAU/mL and 160 HAU/mL. The inter-assay CV of SRDFDS for influenza A detection using F580 was 6.10%, and that of H5 HA detection using F650 was 9.14%, demonstrating that SRDFDS is an accurate technique because the range of inter-assay CVs was below 15% [40] .

              "  'text': 'QD-based electrochemical assays have been extensively explored because of their optical properties, tunability, and potential for multiplexing in POCT. So far, preventing nonspecific reactions in QDs and increasing solubility have been major challenges because the use of high-temperature organometallic synthetic procedures produces monodisperse nanocrystals with a passivated surface containing a monolayer of hydrophobic surfactant ligands [44] [45] [46] . QDs are insolubly monodispersed with a very wide range of possible emission spectra ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared that can be controlled by simply changing their size, composition, and structure [36, 37] . For water compatibility and bioconjugation, QDs are covered with a hydrophilic shell which is a popular method to solubilize QDs in aqueous media and improve their signal intensity through encapsulation with polymers [31, 32] . To apply QDs to POCT, encapsulation of QDs with a polymer was routinely used to amplify the fluorescent signal, and few trials have attempted to use polymers on QD surface for POCT systems [31, 32, 47] . This may reflect the weakness of the fluorescent signal of QDs making it difficult to be captured by POCT. An additional method of encapsulating many QDs in one particle was suggested to amplify the fluorescent signal from the QD nanoparticles [32] . Currently, a rapid dual POCT system has been developed that detects two different pathogen species rather than two antigen targets in one pathogen [33] . However, simultaneous detection of two antigens of one pathogen, HPAI H5N1, would strengthen the primary screening of POCT and inform clinicians of the H5-infection potential, although the patient may test negative due to the relatively small amount of H5-specific antigen compared to influenza A NP antigen.'},\n",

Taken together, we believe that our limit of detection and quantitative range enabled detection of a fatal H5N1 human case. We have provided evidence by diluting HPAI H5N1 virus in addition to H5N3, which showed a good linear regression in this TL/CL range (Fig. S17) . As Fig. 7 shows, the cross-reactivity of influenza A TL obtained by F650 nm at 160 HAU/mL was not derived from the random binding of QD650 conjugate to influenza A test line.

In a proportion of affected dogs, MV regurgitation is severe enough to cause an increase in left atrial (LA) volume and pressure. LA function was reported to decline with increased disease severity. Pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor exerting positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects, was shown to decrease LA pressure, although its effect on LA function is not well established.

The accuracy of this estimation is unknown in dogs with MMVD, but experimental studies suggest that the method is imperfect.

Data were collected from the veterinary cardiology departments' databases, selecting patients with advanced MMVD associated LAT. Signalment, clinical presentation, echocardiography, selected laboratory findings, the cause of death and survival data were evaluated. Parameters were assessed upon LAT diagnosis (time 0, T0) and at the resolution of pericardial effusion (time 1, T1). Control dogs with similarly advanced MMVD were selected based on quantitative echocardiographic parameters matching those of LAT dogs at T1. Thirty client-owned dogs were included: 15 dogs with MMVD associated LAT and 15 control dogs without LAT. In both groups, 9 dogs were in ACVIM congestive heart failure stage C and 6 in B2 MMVD. Commonly observed clinical signs included dyspnoea, syncope and weakness. No significant differences were found in age (both groups 10 AE 2 years, P = 0.89), body weight (both groups 7 AE 5 kg, P > 0.99), gender distribution (LAT group: 7 females, control group: 10 females, P = 0.46), serum creatinine concentration (LAT group: 131 umol/L AE 72, control group: 108 umol/L AE 39, P = 0.42) or echocardiographic variables between the groups.

Hypovitaminosis D in people has been associated with increased susceptibility and severity of illness with a variety of inhaled respiratory pathogens. Sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) is a common cause of chronic nasal disease that remains a challenge to treat and is associated with substantial morbidity and non-survival in dogs. There is a lack of biomarkers that can predict the development of SNA and treatment outcome in dogs.

Nine dogs with SNA and 8 healthy control dogs were in included in the retrospective arm of this study. Serum samples were obtained from these 17 dogs between 2017 and 2019 and stored at −80 C until analysis. Diagnosis of SNA was based on presence of compatible clinical signs and per-endoscopic identification of fungal plaques with turbinate destruction and fungal culture. Treatment was deemed successful if there was resolution of clinical signs and absence of fungal plaques on follow-up rhinoscopy. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using HPLC. Seventy-eight percent of dogs with SNA had complete fungal debridement. Seven dogs had follow-up available of which 57% (4/7) had first time treatment success.

However, studies analyzing the role of HHM in WHO lymphoma types are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HHM among different lymphoma types and its prognostic impact on survival. In a retrospective study data of dogs diagnosed with untreated lymphoma between 2008 and 2019 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were availability of WHO type and serum/plasma calcium concentration. 139 cases were included. HHM was present in 14/139 (10%) patients. Most notably only patients with T-lymphomas were affected. 9/14 (64%) suffered from peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTLC) and 5/14 (36%) from T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). HHM occurred in 43% (9/21) of PTLC and 38% (5/13) of T-LBL cases. 86% of patients with HHM showed symptoms attributable to hypercalcemia, predominantly polyuria/polydipsia, neurological (somnolence, weakness), and gastrointestinal manifestation (inappetence). In dogs with HHM, median total and ionized calcium were 3.81 mmol/l (reference interval 2.4-3.0) and 1.8 mmol/l (reference interval 1.25-1.5), respectively. Under chemotherapy calcium concentration returned to normal in 93% of cases. No significant differences in progression free survival (150 vs. 60 days, P = 0.29) or lymphoma specific survival (170 vs. 135 days, P = 0.42) were observed between hypercalcemic and normocalcemic dogs of both subtypes.

Based on this, prognostic factors might need to be stratified for life stages.DisclosuresDisclosures to report.', 'latex': None, 'type': 'figure'}, {'text': 'Not Reduce Infusion-Related Ventricular Arrhythmias in Dogs Treated with Doxorubicin J.L.

AAS divides patients into four stages based on localized disease (I), multiple nodal sites on one side (II), disseminated nodal disease on both sides of diaphragm (III), and in other extranodal sites (IV). In comparison to the veterinary WHO staging system (WHOS) AAS considers a splenic infiltration as nodal involvement, but not as a higher stage. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare WHOS and AAS to predict treatment response and survival in 54 canine nodal DLBCL treated with CHOP between 2008-2019. Because of low number of stage I/II patients (n = 3) in both systems, these were excluded. There were nine stage III, 28 stage IV, and 17 stage V cases in WHOS, and 23 stage III, and 31 stage IV cases in AAS. No association between WHOS and grade, substage, B-symptoms and treatment response were found. Higher AAS stage was associated with substage B (P = 0.03) and B-symptoms (P = 0.002) and negatively with treatment response (P = 0.001).

Chemotherapy has been the main stay of therapy for decades for feline alimentary lymphoma. Overall response rates reported from 50-92% and overall survival times range from days to >3 years depending on the protocol utilized and the histologic form. For small cell lymphoma, treatment generally has involved the use of glucocorticoids in combination with chlorambucil (Leukeran). There is currently no standardized protocol for the use of these drugs with some clinicians choosing to continue the therapy for a defined period of time (6-12 months) or indefinitely until disease progression in the patient. The aim of this study is to establish a foundation for use of low-dose radiation therapy for feline intermediate and for treatment of intermediate and small cell alimentary lymphoma in feline patients. Exclusion criteria, disease extension beyond intestines and liver. Recorded information included patient signalment, baseline bloodwork, date, method of diagnosis, staging diagnostics, date of treatment initiation with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, any hematological abnormalities, first response duration to radiation therapy, and date of progression and/or death if available for the patient. Ten cats diagnosed with alimentary lymphoma were treated with lowdose radiation. Seven cats diagnosed with small cell lymphoma were treated with 3 Gy total and three diagnosed with intermediate cell lymphoma were treated with 4 Gy total. Acute effects associated with radiation therapy were not observed. Median overall survival time for cats treated with radiation therapy was 1368 days, the median overall survival time for the control population receiving chemotherapy alone was 1161 days. Radiation therapy appears to be efficacious and well tolerated with no clinically relevant adverse effects reported. In addition to the favorable adverse event profile, low-dose radiation was extremely convenient for the patients and clients as a number of these clients have to travel long distances for treatment, monitoring and follow-up. Client compliance and satisfaction improved due to a variety of factors such as reduced number of at-home medications, hospital visits and financial burden.

Although, no specific recent studies about the relationship between US and clinicopathological features and severity of canine AP are available. The aim of the study was to evaluate abdominal ultrasound features in relation with canine Spec cPL, severity of disease and outcome in suspected canine AP. Dogs with suspected AP hospitalized between 2017 and 2019 were prospectively enrolled. AP was suspected based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) at admission. Data regarding abdominal pain were recorded and serum samples for Spec cPL were sent to a commercial laboratory (Idexx Laboratories). US was performed at presentation, and every 24 h until 2 days from hospitalization. US was considered consistent with AP if there were hypoechoic and enlarged pancreas, irregular shape and margins, surrounded by hyperechoic mesentery and/or abdominal effusion. Recently developed Canine Acute PancreatitisSeverity (CAPS) score was calculated and dogs were divided into groups (CAPS <11 and > 11. Mortality rate was assessed at hospital discharge. US positivity at presentation was compared with the presence of abdominal pain, mortality rate and CAPS using Fisher's exact test. OR was also calculated. Spec cPL values were US-group). No association between mortality and US positivity was found. Twenty-two dogs (47%) presented with abdominal pain. Dogs showing abdominal pain had significantly higher prevalence (88%) of positive US than dogs without abdominal pain (P = 0.0014; OR 10.22). CAPS and US positivity were not associated, although CAPS was associated with mortality (P = 0.0021; OR 9.3). Spec cPL were not significantly different between positive or negative US at presentation, and 8 dogs had negative US at admission, which became positive afterwards with Spec cPL < 400 mg/L. Interestingly, 4 dogs were in US-group, despite a Spec cPL > 400 mg/L.In dogs with AP, changes in US could occur later during hospitalization, although the presence of abdominal pain at presentation may suggest US positivity. Furthermore, US positivity seems to be related neither with Spec cPL nor to the prognosis or the severity of the disease.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESCG-P-5Gastric mucosal pathology in Belgian Shepherd dogs with and without clinical signs of gastric disease M.V. Candido, P. Syrjä, M. Hanifeh, S. Kilpinen, T. Spillmann University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Belgian Shepherd dogs (BSD) are considered at increased risk for gastric carcinoma (GC), mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia. In humans, gastric mucosal atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia are all linked to GC. We performed a prospective clinical trial exploring early diagnosis of such conditions. Gastroscopy with histology of mucosal biopsies was conducted to investigate possible associations of clinical signs, atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia and GC.After an online survey for recruitment, anamnesis and laboratory minimal database were performed. Canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) and signs of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were used to ascribe dogs in two groups: with or without signs of gastric disease (Group A: CCECAI >1 and/or GER; Group B: CCECAI = 0 and no GER). Gastric inflammation, including mucosal fibrosis and glandular atrophy, was histologically assessed according to standardization guidelines by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.Mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia were rated as present or absent.Group A included 20 dogs (median age 9 years [5.5-11.6], mean CCE-CAI = 3.4 AE 2.1), and Group B included 11 dogs (median age 9.8 years [7.6-11.3]). Logistic regression analysis detected no statistical difference in histological findings between Groups A and completely of the diffuse, non-cohesive type, including four signet-ring-cell carcinomas and one mucinous adenocarcinoma.This study in BSD showed a high proportion of gastric mucosal pathological changes, regardless of clinical signs of gastric disease; even GC presented repeatedly as an occult entity. The significant association of both metaplasia and dysplasia with GC supports an indication for endoscopic follow-up of affected BSD. Extensive endoscopic screening seems, however, unrealistic for early diagnosis due to the occurrence of occult disease. To address this problem, research on serum biomarkers for GC should be pursued. Future studies should also revise the diagnostic criteria for atrophy.Keywords: gastric, carcinoma, atrophic gastritis, metaplasia, dysplasia, dog.DisclosuresDisclosures to report.Statement of Disclosures -Marcus ViniciusCandido The author has the following disclosures related to their presentation: Employee/salary: Marcus Vinicius Candido has worked in zoos in southern Brazil, having researched on various topics.

ESCG-P-6 Effect of stem cell therapy on serum cobalamin levels in dogs diagnosed with chronic enteritis without cobalamin supplementation J.I. Cristóbal Verdejo, F.J. Duque Carrasco, C. Zaragoza Bayle, R. Barrera Chacón, P. Ruiz Tapia, B. Macías García, J. Usón Casaús, E.M. Pérez Merino Hospital Clínico Veterinario de la Universidad de Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain Cobalamin deficiency is a common finding in dogs diagnosed with chronic enteropathy (CE) due to low absorption and/or bacterial competition. It has been described the importance of hypocobalaminaemia in the long-term prognosis of these patients being cobalamin supplementation highly recommended. Treatment of CE constitutes a therapeutic challenge and new approaches include stem cell therapy. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Extremadura. A single dose of canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of allogeneic adipose origin at 2-4 x 10 6 cells per kilogram of weight was parenterally administered. A blood sample was obtained prior MSCs administration and subsequent cobalamin checkups were performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months; blood samples were submitted to a reference laboratory (Laboklin, Madrid, Spain). Clinical improvement was assessed at the same time points by the Clinical Activity Index (CIBDAI; clinically normal <3). The data were analyzed using a Saphiro-Wilk test and a repeated measures One-Way ANOVA followed by a Dunns or a Holm Sidak post-hoc test; P < 0.05 was considered as significant and results are expressed as mean AE SE of the mean. At the beginning of the study, 75% of dogs (15/20) presented hypocobalaminaemia (<300 pg/ml; laboratorial reference value). Statistically significant differences were observed between pre-treatment cobalamin values (225.3 AE 26 pg/ml) and those analyzed at 3 (360.7 AE 33.5 pg/ml), 6 (423 AE 55.7 pg/ml) and 12 (602.6 AE 54 pg/ml) months of treatment (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between pretreatment values and those obtained after one month of MSCs administration (299.2 AE 41 pg/ml). The CIBDAI significantly improved at all the checkups ranging from 8.2 AE 0.6 (pre-treatment) to 0.7 AE 0.3 (twelve months). CIBDAI was <3 for all groups treated with MSCs. Our results demonstrate that administration of MSCs leads to an increase in serum cobalamin in dogs diagnosed with CE. This increase is associated with an improvement of their clinical status and therefore, MSCs therapy should be considered for the treatment of dogs affected with CE due to their positive impact on the long-term prognosis.

Heilmann 3 1 College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, 2 Texas A&M University, College Station, United States of America, 3 University of Leipzig, College of Veterinary Medic, Leipzig, Germany Chronic inflammatory enteropathies (CIE) comprise an important group of diseases in dogs. Only few biomarkers that can be routinely measured (eg, serum cobalamin and albumin, fecal calprotectin) appear to be of clinical utility in dogs with CIE and can potentially aid in CIE subclassification based on the response to treatment (ie, diagnosis of food-responsive enteropathy [FRE] vs. steroid−/immunosuppressantresponsive enteropathy [IRE]). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was recently shown to have diagnostic and prognostic potential in humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NLR also appears to be useful in the diagnosis of dogs with hypoadrenocorticism, but the NLR has not been evaluated or reported in dogs with CIE. Data from 91 dogs diagnosed with CIE (that had not received steroids for ≥2 weeks prior to diagnostic evaluation) at 2 veterinary centers were used for this study. NLR was calculated as [neutrophil count/ lymphocyte count] and was evaluated for a potential relationship with the severity of clinical signs (CCECAI scoring system, n = 65), serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations (n = 65), histologic lesion severity (4-point semi-quantitative grading system, n = 36), serum and fecal concentrations of other inflammatory markers (n = 60), and the response to treatment (FRE vs. IRE, n = 39). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. NLR ranged from 0.23-54.0 (median: 5.69) in all dogs with CIE. NLR was significantly higher in dogs with very severe clinical signs compared to dogs with mild (P = 0.014) or moderate (P = 0.026) clinicaldisease. NLR was not correlated with the overall histologic score (P > 0.05), but was significantly higher in dogs with histologic lesions compatible with protein-losing enteropathy (P = 0.006). Hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.001), but not hypocobalaminemia, was significantly associated with a higher NLR. NLR correlated significantly with serum S100A12 (P = 0.032), C-reactive protein (P = 0.046), decoy receptor for advanced glycation end products (P = 0.034), and fecal alpha 1proteinase inhibitor (P < 0.001), but not with serum or fecal calprotectin concentrations. Dogs with IRE (n = 26) had significantly higher NLRs (median: 8.41) than dogs with FRE (median: 3.09; n = 13; P = 0.008), and an NLR ≥4.60 best distinguished dogs with IRE from those with FRE (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 69%).Our findings suggest that neutrophils play a role in the systemic inflammatory response associated with CIE in dogs. NLR (ie., leukogram changes) in canine CIE are of similar magnitude as in human IBD. NLR can be easily obtained during routine hematology, and can potentially aid in the subclassification of dogs with CIE. The potential utility of NLR in the monitoring of dogs with CIE requires further investigation.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.Not applicable.ESCG-P-8 Calprotectin concentrations are increased in the intestinal mucosa of dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathies M.

Moniz 3 , K. 2+ − binding protein of the S100/calgranulin family, has potential as a marker of inflammation in dogs and mainly originating from granulocytes. Increased canine calprotectin concentrations have been detected in feces and serum samples from dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE). However, intestinal mucosal calprotectin concentrations have not been extensively investigated in canine CIE. We evaluated the mucosal concentrations of calprotectin in dogs with CIE in comparison with healthy Beagle dogs using a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) method on a clinical chemistry analyzer. Additionally, we assessed the association of mucosal calprotectin levels with the canine clinical IBD activity index (CIBDAI), histopathologic findings, clinical outcome, and serum albumin concentrations. Intestinal mucosal biopsies were collected from 38 dogs with CIE (duodenum [n = 34], ileum [n = 10], colon [n = 14], and caecum [n = 7]). Archived intestinal tissue samples from 18 healthy Beagle dogs served as controls (duodenum [n = 17], ileum [n = 18], colon [n = 18], and caecum [n = 6]). Data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges). In comparison to healthy Beagles, mucosal calprotectin concentrations of CIE-dogs were higher in the duodenum (332 [91-639] vs. 94 [24-137] μg/L; P = 0.001) and colon (380 [187-542] vs. 112 [36-196] μg/L; P = 0.002). Histologic severity was significantly associated with mucosal calprotectin levels (P < 0.05) for total histopathology score, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the duodenum, and epithelial injury in the colon. Duodenal calprotectin concentrations were higher in hypoalbuminemic dogs than normoalbuminemic dogs (1441 [1098-1748] μg/L vs. 227 [74-506] μg/L), but because of the small number of hypoalbuminemic dogs (n = 4) the results were only descriptively reported. There was no significant association of mucosal calprotectin levels with CIBDAI scores or with the clinical outcome. This study showed that mucosal calprotectin concentrations are increased in the duodenum and colon of dogs with CIE. The results provide supporting evidence for the potential diagnostic value of mucosal (or fecal) calprotectin concentrations in dogs with CIE. Further prospective research is needed to assess the value of measuring mucosal calprotectin concentrations in clinical practice, the relationship between mucosal and fecal calprotectin, and other inflammatory markers in dogs with CIE.\", 'latex': None, 'type': 'figure'}, {'text': 'Novel Canine-Specific Model System to Study Intestinal P-Glycoprotein-Mediated Drug Transport Y.M.

Allenspach Iowa State University, Ames, United States of America Dietary fat composition has been shown to modulate fecal microbiota composition and impact host health. High-fat diets have been linked to reduced fecal microbial diversity, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and low-grade systemic (LPS) inflammation. While high-fat diets may modulate the fecal microbiota, there is no data available on the impact of high-fat diets on the canine mucosal microbiota. The aim of the study was to investigate changes in composition of the mucosal microbiota and serum metabolome in Beagle dogs fed two rations varying in their content of dietary fat. Eight healthy adult Beagle dogs were fed a control diet (13% fat), followed by low-carbohydrate diet (1% starch) containing either 32% fat (T1) or 46.5% fat (T2) for 2 weeks each in randomized order. Endoscopic biopsies of the small and large intestines and sera were collected for analysis of mucosal microbiota and metabolomic profiles, respectively, before and during dietary intervention. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a 4-probe array (ie, total bacteria, Firmicutes [Clostridium cluster XIVa], Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae) quantified colonic mucosal bacteria into distinct compartments. Serum metabolomic profiles resulting from the different diets were quantified by a targeted approach to analyze samples using mass spectrometry and the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p400 HR Kit. Metabolite changes between diets were analyzed by PCA, PLS-DA, the adherent mucus. There was no difference in the total number and spatial distribution of bacteria within the mucosa of dogs fed control diet versus T1. For the different bacterial groups, sub-populations of Clostridium spp. were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in adherent mucus of dogs fed T2 versus T1. Changes in mucosal bacteria were accompanied by altered serum metabolomes of dogs fed either T1 or T2. Perturbations in lipid metabolism predominated and primarily involved different glycerophospholipids (GPL), including the phosphatidylcholines (PC) and acylcarnitines (AC). Most GPLs were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in dogs fed T2 but not T1 when compared to control ration. Conversely, T2 also resulted in lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of other lipid metabolites and select amino acids.

Hervé 3 , J.M. of Veterinary Medicin, Nantes, France, 3 Cellular and Molecular Immuno-Endocrinology Unit, INRA, Nantes-Atlantic College, Nantes, France Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic gastrointestinal disease in dogs. The current paradigm of IBD involves complex interactions between environmental factors, such as the intestinal microbiota, and dysregulated host responses. Toll-Like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 recognize bacterial Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). In a previous study, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 mRNAs were reported to be up-regulated in the inflamed duodenal and colonic mucosa of IBD dogs compared to asymptomatic healthy Beagles. The aim of this study was with IBD were included in this study. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs of at least 3 weeks' duration, the presence of a lymphocytic and plasmacytic and/or eosinophilic inflammation on colon biopsies and exclusion of other causes of chronic gastrointestinal signs. Nine dogs were included in the control group. Colon paraffin-embedded biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry using anti-human TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 antibodies. The expression of TLRs in the different samples was graded from 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression) by a board-certified pathologist in a blinded fashion. TLR5 and TLR9 were detected both in the epithelial cells and in the lamina propria cells. In contrast, TLR2 was detected only in the epithelial cells while TLR4 staining was restricted to the leucocytes of the lamina propria. No statistical differences were found in TLRs expression when comparing IBD dogs with asymptomatic dogs although epithelial TLR9 expression tended to be higher in the IBD group (P = 0,054). To our knowledge, our study describes for the first time the pattern of expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 in the colon of dogs and suggests that their expression is poorly affected by IBD. Further experiments are warranted in a larger number of patients and in other intestinal segments (duodenum and ileum) to analyze whether epithelial TLR9 expression might be correlated with clinical activity or histopathology score.

The LA diameter is usually evaluated on the right parasternal transaortic short-axis view and compared to the aortic (Ao) diameter (LA:Ao ratio). However, LA dilation can develop in medio-lateral, cranio-caudal, or ventro-dorsal directions. Therefore, the LA:Ao ratio may not be reliable for the early detection of LA dilation. Measurements of LA volumes have been recently recommended in the dog using monoplane and biplane Simpson's modified methods of discs (SMOD) and area-length methods (ALM). The objectives of this prospective study were therefore to 1) compare different echocardiographic methods in evaluating LA volume in a large population of CKCs and 2) to assess LA volume according to DMVD severity. The study population consisted in 160 CKCs either healthy or affected by DMVD (median weight = 9.15 kg [interquartile range (IQR) = 7.8-10.3], male-to-female ratio = 0.95). According to the ACVIM classification, 28/160 dogs (17.5%) had no identifiable DMVD lesions (stage A), 86/160 (53.8%) and 22/160 (13.8%) were in stages B1 and B2, respectively, 23/160 (14.3%) had past or current congestive heart failure (CHF, stage C), and 1/160 (0.6%) had refractory CHF (stage D).

EPSS is an important index in the diagnosis of occult and symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as recently reported in the European screening guidelines for DCM in Doberman Pinschers. EPSS can be measured from the right parasternal long axis view (RPLA) or from the right parasternal short axis view (RPSA).

Before and after flight events: changes in exercise intolerance, appetite, respiratory rate and frequency of coughing, gastrointestinal signs and presence of syncope were evaluated. Also presence or absence of events related to heart disease post-flying and postoperative discharge rate were studied. All cases boarded the cabin. Thirty-five patients were able to return home (2 dogs without surgery). Two dogs developed events related to mitral valve disease (1 left atrium rupture and 1 pulmonary edema, respectively). The dog with left atrial rupture died before surgery and she did not receive cardiac medications during the flight. The dog that developed pulmonary edema post-flight also missed a dose during the journey, but responded to medical therapy after the landing. Both of the dogs were in ACVIM classification stage D. About 20% of cases showed changes in physical condition (exercise intolerance, appetite) before and after flight. None of the changes required treatment. Two dogs showed gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) before flight. Three patients developed diarrhea after the flight. Among patients who showed respiratory symptoms before and after flight, 38% showed respiratory distress and 19% showed worseing in coughing. There were 5 dogs with syncopal episodes before the flight; however, none of the dogs fainted after the flight. One dog had post-flight syncope.. Although dogs with mitral valve disease may show clinical changes related to air travel, these are only transient and can be alleviated with symptomatic treatment. Post-flight cardiac disease related symptoms can be prevented by managing the medication time with alarm clock or other devices when travelling across timezones. Avoidance of med-ication errors that may be caused by inexperienced while moving and misreading of the clock due to time difference may be sufficient to avert mitral valve disease related events with sufficient alertness.

In cats, blood for transfusion is commonly collected using an open system and administered as WB, in part because of the challenge of preparing components from a small blood volume. Feline blood has a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate; therefore, if the syringe containing collected blood is placed upright, plasma can be removed from the red cells shortly after collection for separate storage of plasma and PRBCs. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of feline PRBC units obtained by blood sedimentation both at collection and after storage for 42 days.Blood was collected from fourteen feline blood donors into three 20 mL syringes pre-charged with CPDA-1:blood ratio of 1:7 using an open system.

Significant reduction was found in PLT count (−249 AE 189 μL/10 3 ). Comparing PRBC at D0 and D42 a significant increase was found in percentage hemolysis (+ 1.2%), morphological index (+ 0.9) and a significant reduction in RBC count (−460 AE 679 μL/10 3 ), Hct percentage (−3.2 AE 3.5%), WBC count (median − 2589 μL/10 3 ), and PLT count (median − 43 μL/10). All blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.PRBC units obtained by sedimentation of donated blood appear to be a suitable blood component for treatment of normovolemic anemia.However storage for 42 days, as suggested for canine and feline PRBC units, resulted in significant hematological changes that could reduce oxygen delivery after transfusion.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVIM-P-21Bronchoscopic findings in dogs with bronchial vegetal foreign bodies: a retrospective study of 52 cases(2010-2019) J.

They can result in a variety of other clinical signs and endoscopic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to describe the foreign body location, rate of retrieval success, complications, and macroscopic endoscopic findings in dogs with vegetal foreign bodies. Fifty two dogs were included in this retrospective evaluation from the medical records of dogs admitted between 2010 and 2019 for a bronchial vegetal foreign body. Diagnosis was based on direct visualisation during the bronchoscopic exam or after surgical retrieval. 27 males and 25 females were included in this study. More than half were hunting dogs (29/52). Duration of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 1400 days. Cough was the main clinical sign (49/52). Foreign bodies were removed from a right-sided bronchus in 35/52 (67%) cases, from a left-sided bronchus in 11/52 (21%) cases, from both right and left bronchi in 6/52 (12%) cases. Endoscopic retrieval was successful in 43 of 52 cases (83%). Nine dogs needed a surgical treatment.

Olds Iowa State University, Ames, United States of America Though the role of cats as a reservoir for B. henselae has long been established, the prevalence of infection or exposure of cats to other Bartonella species or to other vector-borne diseases remains unreported. Using serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prevalence of exposure and bacteremia of vector-borne infections (Anaplasmaspp, Babesiaspp, Cytauxzoonspp, Ehrlichiaspp, Rickettsiaspp, Piroplasma,Mycoplasmaspp, and Bartonellaspp.) was assessed in a population of free-roaming cats in a rural area of the Midwestern United States. Serum and EDTA blood samples were collected from 65 freeroaming cats captured as part of a community spay and neuter program. Testing with PCR revealed that 9 cats (14%) were positive for Bartonella species (6 for B. henselaeand 3 for B. clarridgeiae) and 7 cats (11%) were positive for Mycoplasma species (6 for M. haemominutim and 1 for M. haemofelis). Serological testing revealed that 50 cats (83%) were positive for antibodies against Bartonella species. More specifically, 50 cats were positive for B. koehlerae, 47 were positive for B. henselae and 42 were positive for B. vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi. A significant positive correlation was identified between positive Bartonella spp. PCR results and the presence of antibodies against B. vinsonii berkhoffi and B. henselae. All cats that were positive for Bartonella by PCR had positive serologies for all three species of Bartonella tested. Odds ratio analysis of age, sex and weight revealed that male cats were at increased risk for exposure to B. vinsonii berkhoffi. Disclosures Disclosures to report.

Bommer, S. Salavati, R.J. Mellanby, A. Gow Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Easter Bush Campus, Midlothian, United Kingdom Pathogenic Leptospira species pose a risk to canine and human health worldwide. There is very little published data on positive cases of leptospirosis seen in veterinary practice in the United Kingdom. This study aims to analyze all cases tested for leptospirosis in a UK university teaching hospital between 2011 and 2018. Data was retrospectively collected from a university database; all dogs that were screened for leptospirosis via urine PCR, blood PCR, or serum MAT were included (n = 153). Cases vaccinated within 12 months with an MAT titre<1:800, in addition to testing negative for both urine and blood PCR, were excluded from the positive category (n = 17). Of the remaining 136 cases, 39 tested positive for leptospirosis. The number of positive cases among those tested was 11/30 (36.6%) in 2016, 18/64 (28.1%) in 2017 and 10/56 (17.8%) in 2018; the 3 cases tested between 2011 and 2016 were all negative. Of the positive cases, 61.5% (24/39) had been vaccinated with a leptospiral vaccine within 12 months and 53.8% (21/39) had received antibiotic therapy prior to referral.\", 'latex': None, 'type': 'figure'}, {'text': 'Clínico San Carlos (Servicio de Medicina Preventiva), Madrid, Spain, 3 Facultad de Veterinaria.

In this 13-year single-centre cross-sectional study, CT reports of dogs underwent thoracic CT examination for various reasons were reviewed. Patients' characteristics were assessed for likely associations with RAA. Radiographic and echocardiographic studies were also evaluated when available. Continuous data were assessed for normality of distribution with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Dogs with RAA were compared with dogs without RAA for the variable gender and sexual status using Chi-Square test. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to analyse age and body weight of groups. The body condition score (five points scoring system) was analyzed using the Fischer's exact test. Nonnormally distributed data were reported as median, interquartile range (IQR), and range. For all statistical analyses, the significance level was set to α = 0.05. CT data of dogs with RAA were retrieved from archive and analyzed using various post-processing techniques. RAA location and shape were recorded. Oblique multiplanar views were used such that the area to be measured was orthogonal to the long axis of the RAA. RAA measurements included the neck, maximum height and width. Additional CT features of cardiac and extracardiac structures were also recorded. RAA was detected in 23/10886 dogs having thoracic CT in the selected period of time (0.21% prevalence). Radiographic and echocardiographic studies were available for 10/23 dogs.A mediastinal mass were visible in 2/10 radiographs. Echocardiographic examination disclosed RAA in 4/10 dogs with pulmonary hypertension. The bodyweights of dogs with RAA were significantly lower than those of the remaining 10 836 dogs without RAA (median 8 kg [IQR 5; range 37.6] and median 16 kg[IQR 23; range 116.9]    respectively; P = 0.003). Female sex was also significantly associated with RAA (P = 0.03). Four/23 dogs had also right atrial dilatation.Three different RAA phenotypes were detected: sack-like in 19/23 dogs, focal lump-like in 3/23 dogs, and fusiform in 1/23 dog. Results of CT measurements were: mean of the neck 1.48 cm [IQR 1; range 2.6]; mean height 3.06 cm [IQR 1.39; range 4.85], and mean width 1.64 cm [IQR 1; range 3.1]. RAA is an infrequent (0.21%) and often incidental condition that can have different phenotypes. In this study, female sex and smaller size showed an association with RAA.

Congestive signs were defined as tachypnea, dyspnea and cough that resolved with medical treatment for HF. Medical records of 5122 dogs enrolled in the LOOK-Mitral registry from 1st November 2015 to 31st July 2018 were reviewed to identify dogs with stable ACVIM-Stage C MMVD defined as dogs with CS and unchanged medical treatment for at least four weeks since the first identification of HF. The study population was composed by 186 dogs, subsequently divided into two groups: reoccurrence group (RG, n = 66) and no reoccurrence group (NRG, n = 120). Reoccurrence of CS was defined by resting respiratory rate > 40 breath/minute and/or dyspnea, within the study period, that resolved after furosemide increase. Baseline body weight (BW) (OR:1.11, 90%CI:1.06-1.17), presence of cough (OR:1.98, 90%CI:1.05-3.74), left atrial-aortic ratio (LA/Ao)(OR: 3.08, 90%CI:1.38-6.86), left ventricular internal diameter at enddiastole (OR: 3.41, 90%CI:1.22-9.50) and end-systole (OR: 7.61, 90% CI:2.32-24.90) indexed to body size, mitral valve peak E wave velocity(OR: 3.44, 90%CI:1.63-7.27), and furosemide daily dosage (OR:1.32, 90%CI:1.04-1.67) were associated with reoccurrence of CS in the univariate analysis. The BW (P = 0.0003) and LA/Ao (P = 0.0196) remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Increment of 0.1 of LA/Ao or of 1 kg in body weight were both associated with 1.1 increased odds of reoccurrence.This study suggests that BW and LA/Ao are independent predictors of reoccurrence of CS in dogs with stable ACVIM-Stage C MMVD.Disclosures to report.Dr. Michele Borgarelli receives financial support from Ceva Sante Animale for studies unrelated to this Abstract.Dr. Alessandra Franchini receives finical support form Ceva Sante Animale for her PhD.', 'latex': None, 'type': 'table'}, {'text': 'All the study was funded by Affinity Petcare SA.

From this dataset, a hyperthyroid treated group was identified, from this treated population a total of 479 subnormal TT4 cats were identified, defined as having a TT4 < 0.8 μg/dL post hyperthyroid treatment. The remaining cats were euthyroid after treatment. A four-to-one comparative age-matched control group of post treatment euthyroid cats to subnormal TT4 cats was used to evaluate SDMA and Cr pre-and post-treatment. A McNemar's paired test or Chi-square test was used where appropriate. A significant increase in the number of subnormal TT4 cats with an SDMA concentration above the reference interval was found compared to euthyroid controls post-treatment (39.6% (190/479)    vs. 32.1% (616/1916), P < 0.001). Cr concentrations were also increased above the reference interval in a significantly greater number of subnormal TT4 cats as compared to controls post-treatment (25.9% (124/479) vs. 12.8% (246/1916), P < 0.001). In the subnormal TT4 group increased SDMA concentrations identified 13.7% more cats with potential decrease in GFR and reduction in renal function than Cr. This study confirms that a significant percentage of cats with subnormal TT4 attributed to overtreatment of hyperthyroidism have abnormal renal biomarkers as compared to those that are euthyroid following therapy. The big data used for this study supports the importance of avoiding iatrogenic hypothyroidism. The identified association of reduced renal function with iatrogenic hypothyroidism emphasizes the importance of avoiding overtreatment.

Ollier 2 , B. Catchpole 3 , L.J. Kennedy 2 Royal Veterinary College, University of London, London, United Kingdom, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 3 Royal Veterinary College, London, United Kingdom Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) can be classified as insulin resistance or insulin deficiency diabetes, with all cases requiring daily insulin injections to control hyperglycaemia. A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to lead to the development of the disease, including immune-mediated destruction of beta cells. Disease risk differs considerably between breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved, but environmental triggers are also thought to play a role. In human Type 1 DM, the region of the genome containing the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) MHC class II genes confers approximately 50% of the genetic risk. Associations with dog leucocyte antigen(DLA) class II haplotypes have also been identified in diabetic dogs, but investigations to date have considered all breeds together. This study aimed to identify breed-specific diabetes-associated DLA haplotypes in an expanded data set. Taking the 18 most highly represented breeds in our previous study, we increased the DLA-typing data from 294 to 736 diabetic dogs and from 501 to 1083 breed-matched nondiabetic controls to enable breed-specific statistical analysis.Dogs were genotyped for DLA-DRB1, −DQA1 and -DQB1 using sequence-based typing of DNA (extracted from blood surplus to diagnostic requirements).

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (3CG) and carbapenemaseproducing (CP) Enterobacteriaceae are of particular importance as their easily transmitted resistance genes mediate resistance to many antimicrobial classes. The aims of this study were: to assess the prevalence of MDRO carriage in dogs and cats at presentation to veterinary clinics/practices, to monitor MDRO acquisition during hospitalization, to study MDRO transmission among pets and owners and to determine the duration of carriage. For this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, rectal and nasal/ oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 88 cats and 183 dogs presented to 5 veterinary care facilities and 187/271 animals were resampled at discharge. Participating owners sampled themselves (nasal swab/stool sample). Carriers were resampled for up to 8 months.

Pierini, I. Lippi, V. Meucci, F. Battaglia, F. Perondi, V. Marchetti University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a sensitive renal biomarker whose concentrations increase earlier than creatinine as glomerular filtration rate decreases. So far in humans, SDMA is considered an important early biomarker of kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate SDMA in dogs with acute pancreatitis (AP) and their association with kidney injury and severity of disease. Dogs with AP, presented at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of University of Pisa between 2017 and 2019, were prospectively enrolled. AP diagnosis was based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) and positive abdominal ultrasound within 48 h from admission. Dogs with a history of renal diseases (clinical records/history, bloodwork and diagnostic imaging), urinary tract infection and/or on hemodialysis treatment were excluded, along with dogs that had received known nephrotoxic drugs (eg. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides).For each dog, data about urea, creatinine and urinary output (UO) were recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) grading was made based on current IRIS consensus. Canine Acute Pancreatitis Severity (CAPS) was calculated for each dog at presentation and previously described cut-off of 11 was used to divide dog into two groups (CAPS < and > 11). SDMA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SDMA was compared between UO groups (O, NO), presence of AKI and with CAPS score groups using Mann-Whitney U-test or Welch's t-test based on normality distribution. SDMA was correlated with urea and creatinine levels using Spearman's correlation test.Fifty-one dogs with diagnosis of AP were enrolled with owners' informed consent. Sixteen dogs showed AKI and 11 of them were oligo-anuric. Overall median SDMA was 13.8 mg/dL (range 0.6-65 mg/dL). Twenty-three dogs (45%), of which 13 in non-AKI group, had SDMA above reference range (15 mg/dL). Median SDMA was significantly higher in AKI dogs (18.5 vs. 12.4 mg/dL; P = 0.01).Both urea and creatinine concentration showed a positive correlation with SDMA level in AKI dogs (P = 0.01 r = 0.6 and P = 0.006 r = 0.7, respectively) but the same correlations were not significant in non-AKI group. No association between SDMA and UO was found. Finally, dogs with CAPS>11 had higher SDMA compared to dogs with CAPS<11 (26.9 AE 5 mg/dL vs. 13.8 AE 1.5 mg/dL, P = 0.03). Based on our results, SDMA seems to be associated with disease severity (CAPS).SDMA correlates well with kidney disfunction parameters (urea and creatinine) and results higher in AKI dogs. Interestingly, about 1/3 of non-AKI dogs presents abnormal SDMA that can be related to a subclinical kidney impairment.No disclosures to report.Evaluation of a point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay for detection of significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats S.S.

Sørensen 1 1 University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark, 2 AniCura Københavns Dyrehospital, Copenhagen, Denmark There is a need for affordable point-of-care (POC) tests to accurately detect significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats. Such tests may help practitioners in limiting unnecessary empirical antimicrobial treatment while improving patient outcome. The aim of the study was to compare a lateral flow immunoassay POC (RapidBac™Vet) for detection of bacteriuria, to standard aerobic quantitative bacterial culture (QBC) at a reference laboratory. The study was designed as a prospective cohort study. Urine samples were collected from dogs and cats presenting to the University Hospital for Companion Animals. Samples were subjected in parallel to RapidBac-Vet and QBC. POC results were interpreted by six investigators blinded to the gold standard results for coefficient of variation calculations. Surplus urine samples from 79 dogs and 21 cats were included (58% by cystocentesis). Forty-four samples yielded ≥1000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml on QBC, of which 20 yielded heavy growth (≥100 000 CFU/mL). POC sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 71%, 77%, 71% and 77%, respectively. Eight of the 13 false negative samples grew Staphylococcus spp.By applying a cut-off of ≥100 000 CFU/mL, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values changed to 80%, 65%, 36% and 93%, respectively. The intra-assay and inter-rater coefficients of variation were 1.4-3.23% and 83%, respectively.These results suggest that RapidBac™Vet is of limited value as a sole discriminatory test for urinary tract infection.

Pantaleo, T. Furlanello, M. Caldin San Marco Veterinary Clinic, Veggiano, Italy Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. Due to the risk of dog-to human transmission of leptospirosis and the need of monitoring urine output in dogs with acute kidney injury it is highly recommended to place an indwelling urinary catheter during hospitalization. Urinary catheterization can predispose to urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate type and frequency of UTI in dogs with leptospirosis and to identify risk factors associated with UTI in leptospirotic dogs.The electronic data-base of the San Marco Veterinary Clinic P.O.A System-Plus 9.0 was searched between January-2008 and December-2018 for dogs with diagnosis of leptospirosis (n = 78). Diagnosis of leptospirosis was consistent clinicopathologic signs, a positive microscopic agglutination test (titer ≥1:1600 in vaccinated dogs, titer ≥1:800 in non-vaccinated dogs or ≥ 4-fold increase in convalescent titer) and/or a positive PCR (urine and/or blood). Dogs with leptospirosis to be included in the study need to met the following criteria: negative urine sediment and urine culture at arrival, ≥ 3 days hospitalization, and a urine sample for cytologic examination and bacterial culture during hospitalization. Dogs meeting inclusion criteria were divided in 2 groups: catheterized dogs (group 1) and noncatheterized dogs (group 2). Differences in UTI frequency between groups was evaluated (Fisher's exact test). Association between duration of catheterization and risk of developing UTI was analysed (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were evaluated for association with UTI (Chi-square test). Significance level for all statistical test was set at α < 0.05. A total of 76 dogs met inclusion criteria: 25 in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Overall 5/76 (7%, all in group 1) dogs developed a UTI. Identified bacteria were: Escherichia coli (3 dogs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 dog) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 dog). All UTI were defined as multidrug-resistant.

There are some commercially available veterinary refractometers that are calibrated with different scales for cats and a conversion formula has also been recommended if a refractometer with human scale is used in order to avoid overestimation of the USG in cats. Two recent studies questioned whether a separate scale is necessary for the correct interpretation of the refractometer readings in feline urine.The aim of this study was to compare canine and feline USG readings obtained by a commercial human refractometer with weight/volume measurement USG data. A second aim of the study was to test whether the centrifugation of the urine samples may have an effect on the accuracy of refractometric USG determination.The USG of thirteen canine and fifteen feline urine left over specimens were compared using refractometry and precise weight/volume mea-surement. All urine samples were clear, pale to dark yellow in color. The bias between the two methods was determined by Bland-Altman analysis. The measurements were performed both on uncentrifuged and centrifuged samples. The effect of centrifugation was evaluated by paired T test. The median (1st, 3rd quartiles) USG of the canine samples was 1015 (1008, 1024). The mean (AESD) USG of the feline samples was 1033 (AE11). There were no significant differences between the refractometric USG values of canine or feline urine samples before and after centrifugation. The mean bias between the refractometric and weight/volume determined USG values of the feline samples was 1,8 AE 2,4. Using the generally accepted feline correction formula changed the mean bias to −3,1 AE 3,6. For comparison, the mean bias of the canine samples was −2,9 AE 5,7. Based on our results we can conclude that it is unnecessary to use different scales or correction formulas during the refractometric USG determination of canine or feline urine samples. The use of the feline correction formula may result in a clinically important underestimation of the USG. The USG measurements can be performed both on native and centrifuged urine samples if the urine is clear.

The scientific approaches of the past-including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology-have not been sufficient to address these challenges. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods. These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions. To take full advantage of these innovations, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently initiated the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. As participants of the Systems Biology Program, we think that the time is at hand to redefine the pathogen-host research paradigm.\\n\\n</td>\n",
              "      <td>\\n\\nI nfectious diseases continue to be major health concerns worldwide: hepatitis C, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) are ongoing pandemics. A third of the world population is currently infected with the TB bacillus; millions of people are infected by influenza virus annually; and even though therapeutic drugs have slowed the threat of HIV-1, there is still no definitive cure or viable vaccine in sight. Although influenza virus vaccines provide protection, they must be reformulated annually, and the time lag from the spread of a pandemic virus to the availability of a vaccine is far too long. A universal vaccine against influenza virus is needed to limit high levels of morbidity and mortality. Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, avian H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and dengue fever are a constant threat; and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella outbreaks in the food industry, are costly to society.New research strategies and tactics must be employed to minimize these threats and improve global health. In response to this need, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has sponsored the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. This program consists of four centers, each with its own unique focus on a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens (Fig. 1) . In this perspective, we discuss why the time is right for applying a systems biology approach to infectious disease research and how we are implementing this approach to overcome specific obstacles. This venture requires a new way of thinking about how best to address the challenges of infectious disease research.\\n\\nDEFINING SYSTEMS BIOLOGY\\n\\nIntrinsic to systems biology is the notion that biological systems have \"emergent properties\": that is, their sum is greater than their individual parts, and the biological outcomes of a system cannot be predicted by traditional reductionist methods that study only the individual components (1) . Instead, an understanding of bio-logical systems requires the integration of high-throughput multiomics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, etc.), which are used to construct predictive models of the networks and dynamic interactions between the biological components of the complex pathogen-host system (2) . Through iterative rounds of model development, testing, and filling in the gaps with experimental data, models are refined to provide predictions that can ultimately be used to help identify therapeutic targets and improve clinical outcomes. This iterative cycle of perturbation biology is key to the systems biology approach (Fig. 2 ) and requires the establishment of efficient interdisciplinary collaborations, the building of integrated computational infrastructures, and the generation of self-consistent, comprehensive, and modelspecific experimental data (3) .The technologies, computational methods, and genome information needed to successfully implement this approach now exist. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing have opened the door to sequencing total transcriptomes, encompassing mi-croRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and mRNAs. This has raised the possibility that a previously unappreciated class of RNAs-the long noncoding RNAs-may play important roles in the host response to virus infection (4) . Proteomic technologies and accompanying informatics pipelines are evolving rapidly, with throughput and sensitivity approaching that of microarrays. Metabolomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and phosphoproteomics are young and comparatively undeveloped, but the promise is unlimited and the potential unprecedented. Moreover, the appropriate in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to generate useful pathogen-host interaction models are now available. Each of the four NIAID Systems Biology Centers has taken a unique approach to implementing this new research paradigm as outlined below.\\n\\nNIAID SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CENTERS\\n\\nThe TB Systems Biology Center (http://www.broadinstitute.org /annotation/tbsysbio) at Stanford is using cell culture models, together with a combination of biochemical and transcriptional profiling methods, to characterize the state of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus and the host at each stage of its infectious cycle and during transitions between stages. Each of the three stages is orchestrated by a distinct genetic program that directs the expression of stage-specific antigens and the activation of stage-specific metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. There is an unusually close interaction between the pathogen and the host immune system, which depending on the outcome of this interaction, can lead to a stable, inactive, and asymptomatic infection that is compatible with a normal life span (latency) or to rapid destruction of lung tissue and death (reactivation disease). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is one of the key technologies used to identify the regulatory networks that govern these transitions. Incorporation of these data with results from multidimensional assays that interrogate the status of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and metabolites will lead to the construction of predictive models useful in the development of stage-specific therapeutics (8) .The Systems Virology Center (http://www.systemsvirology .org) at the University of Washington is comprehensively analyzing and modeling the molecular and cellular events, pathogenhost interactions, and cellular response networks induced or altered during the course of respiratory virus infection. This research focuses on highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For each virus, the host response to highly pathogenic wild-type viruses and to engineered viruses with reduced levels of pathogenicity is being analyzed and modeled. These studies use cell culture infection systems, which are the most amenable systems for computation modeling, as well as mouse and macaque infection models. Animal models enable the incorporation of disease-relevant complexity and the validation, extension, and refinement of findings obtained from cell culture systems. Designing and performing experiments so that comparisons can be made across the model systems are an integral but labor-intensive part of the process. The direct communication between biologists and modelers-constant within all of the Systems Biology Centersensures that the experimental designs are suitable in terms of biological sample size, reproducibility, and consistency from highthroughput assays to construction of predictive models and the resulting biological interpretations. The question remains as to whether current computational and modeling techniques are robust enough to generate relevant models given the complexities of these systems. However, only by attempting these types of studies will the required methodologies be developed. \\n\\nPerspective\\n\\nThe Center for Systems Influenza (http://www .systemsinfluenza.org) at the Institute for Systems Biology is using multi-omics approaches to compare the responses of both in vitro and in vivo systems to infection with influenza virus strains of various pathogenicities. The devastating mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic was characterized by both a dysregulated innate immune response and a high susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonias. Computational integration of the transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipidomic data into an appropriate network model will illuminate the detailed signatures of extreme virulence and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses. These studies are being extended to identify and model those hostvirus interactions that predispose an infected lung to secondary bacterial invasion by Staphylococcus aureus. A comprehensive model of the influenza virus-host interaction, aided significantly by recent advances in sequencing technologies and advances in viral genetic manipulation, will serve to calibrate the global public health response to a newly emergent strain as well as uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.The Center for Systems Biology for EnteroPathogens (http: //www.sysbep.org/) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is using regulatory and metabolic modeling, empowered by multiomics data, to characterize the interactions between the host and distantly related bacterial pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Yersinia species. Salmonella is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague. As general models of infection, Salmonella and Yersinia pestis are among the best characterized with in vitro and in vivo animal models. These bacterial pathogens must use a well-orchestrated series of regulatory and metabolic changes to replicate and persist in the inhospitable host environment. Among these highly regulated processes is the process of secreting bacterial proteins into the host that modulate the host's response network. Early efforts have focused on developing methods to investigate and model the coordinated regulatory and metabolic changes occurring in the pathogen during infection and to identify and characterize the secreted bacterial proteins responsible for manipulating the host networks (5, 6) . Understanding the regulatory and metabolic programs required for infection will enable the development of effective therapeutic treatments in the future.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND HOW CAN SUCCESS BE MEASURED?\\n\\nCriticism of systems biology includes the following: \"it's too slow; it's too expensive; it's a fishing expedition.\" We readily admit that systems approaches are currently driven more by technology and computing than by a clear understanding of the data. Indeed, a major challenge is to thoroughly mine the existing data before accumulating even more information. However, critics must be cognizant of the immense challenges involved with this approach. For example, we need to create a new interdisciplinary culture along with a new vocabulary. We need to break down the traditional silos of information present in most scientific research endeavors. We need to merge the experimental with the clinical with FIG 2 Iterative cycles of perturbation biology. The infectious disease questions, the first step in the cycle, determine the appropriate biological models and technologies utilized to generate multidimensional data. Data analysis and integration identify key components, pathways, and networks which allow for the construction of a predictive model. Model-predicted biological bottlenecks or key network nodes are validated by performing additional targeted experiments and data integration, resulting in a refined model. Importantly, several rounds of biological perturbations (i.e., use of mutant pathogens, cellular small interfering RNA [siRNA] knockdowns or knockout mice) are required to produce a predictive model that could be effectively utilized by the general infectious disease community. In addition to a more comprehensive understanding of the host-pathogen response and testable models, this type of perturbation biology will produce publicly disseminated multidimensional data sets and potentially both diagnostic signatures and drug targets. the computational and mathematical. We need to build bridges between diverse members of the scientific community who otherwise do not communicate with each other. The iterative cycle of experimental design, sample preparation, high-throughput assays, and data integration and analysis that is an absolute requirement for an effective systems approach is a lengthy, repetitious, and unglamorous process. But without this iterative progression, predictive and revealing models are not achievable.We acknowledge that the best response to this criticism is to provide fundamental knowledge directly relevant to human health that could not otherwise be achieved through traditional scientific approaches: better cures and vaccines and better drugs and diagnostics. But just as systems biology differs in many aspects from more traditional basic research approaches, the methods for measuring success also differ. Although publications are one important measurement, an additional measure of success is the utilization of the generated resources by the scientific community, including experimental data sets, software tools, computational models, and research protocols, all made available to the scientific community through the four Centers' and NIAID websites (http: //www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/sb/Pages /default.aspx). We call upon researchers outside the Centers to utilize the vast data sets and other resources being generated to further the knowledge and understanding of pathogen-host interactions.As highlighted in a recent review, systems biology is already making important contributions to cancer research (7) . The approach has been used to identify network motifs that can accurately predict the development of distant metastases in breast cancer patients-tumors that may develop years after the primary tumor and which frequently prove fatal. A network-centric approach has also identified specific oncogenes in certain types of B-cell lymphomas, and a multiscale mathematical model has been developed to test the efficacy of different radiation protocols, which has led to improvements in radiation therapies for colorectal cancer. The cancer field was one of the first research communities to aggressively embrace (and fund) the use of systems biology. We believe that the infectious disease community will build on the resulting substantial systems biology methodologies and insights to claim similar successes in the near future. We invite your thoughts and comments on this perspective.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\n\\nThere is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) . It is also known that infections which are transmitted human to human via droplet or close contact spread particularly well in confined spaces. Since transfer options for further treatment are more difficult (especially in detention facilities) preventive measures are strongly emphasized, particularly in the case of viral droplet infections. For example, in the context of influenza, vaccination of detainees and staff is recommended (NHS 2019) . If such options are not available, prisons and other closed facilities, like asylum centers, shelters, and closed psychiatric hospitals, pose a risk for the rapid spread of such diseases. In the past, Australia for example has described the rapid spread of influenza among prison inmates (Awofeso et al., 2001) . The Spanish flu is also reported to have affected about a quarter of all inmates; a prevalence much higher when compared to data from the general population (Finnie, Copley, Hall, &amp; Leach, 2014) . We are also currently receiving news from China, which reports a rapid spread of Covid-19 infections among prisoners from the Hubei Province. Regarding Covid-19, the spread seems to have been caused by infected security personnel importing it into detention facilities. According to the media, the Chinese government reacted to the outbreak among inmates by locking down affected prisons, suspending the transportation of goods, testing inmates who were in contact with the diagnosed wardens, and also by dismissing the prison directors and setting up a commission to analyse the spread of the virus among detained individuals (Caixing Global 2019). Correctly, there has recently been talk of a \"blind spot\" in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates. (Global Times 2020) We argue that the blind spot extends further to particularly marginalized groups such as individuals using and abusing drugs and people without legal residence status, especially since these groups often overlap with individuals in detention (Liem, Wang, Wariyanti, Latkin, &amp; Hall, 2020) . Under normal circumstances, the psychological and psychiatric care of individuals in prison is already a major challenge for many health care systems; a problem that is even more evident in times of crisis, as is currently observed. The difficulties arise on different levels and affect detained individuals, security personnel, as well as medical staff alike (Chen et al., 2020) . Fears, worries, and uncertainties, especially for isolated or quarantined patients, can cause an increase in stress-related illnesses but also the exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (Duan &amp; Zhu, 2020) . This leads to a dilemma: the higher level of care and support that is required is contravened by recommendations that, especially under conditions of isolation, advise against the routine consultation of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in order to prevent the spread of infections. In this situation, medical staff, who are primarily focused on treating the infection (or complications thereof), must then additionally provide psychological care and be ready to intervene during a mental health crisis. Against this backdrop, some authors advocate for the use of online counselling tools and web platforms to support individuals in isolation and those affected (Liu et al., 2020) . Although these recommendations are directed at the general population and not at a prison population, it does not seem reasonable that such channels of care should not be used for individuals under detention as well. Other models could be envisaged, such as the provision of telephone counselling for prisoners and staff. However, for the current outbreak of Covid-19, such elements may not be implemented quickly enough. This raises the question of how to provide rational, basic psychiatric care under the current challenging conditions. We urge that governments take into account special needs of people in confined closed spaces. They must try: -Preserving continuity in provision of psychiatric and psychological care to individuals in detention is imperative and should remain so during the Covid-19 outbreak. -Early coordination between regional prison authorities, prison psychiatry, and general medical and general psychiatric care providers (e.g. in cases of referrals). This must also include close liaison with court diversion schemes, probation officers and others. Some clear guidance needs to be developed urgently regarding visitors to prisons and jails. -Given the potential shortage of time and human resources, the more severe psychiatric and psychological cases must be carefully triaged.Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.From a contemporary perspective, with increasing numbers of reported cases from South Korea, Iran, and Italy and, in some cases, comparably drastic interventions (sealing off entire regions), as well as reports of a rapid spread of Covid-19 among individuals in prison or in other closed societies, the provision of general medical care to those affected has already become a challenge in some parts of the world,. 12 However, it should not be forgotten that psychiatric and psychological care must not just be provided to affected individuals among the general population, but also to vulnerable groups such as people in detention, homes, and asylum centers. Those who survive the infection may experience survivor guilt and those who experience loss of loved ones may experience grief; all the above alongside those who are quarantined will require substantial support.\\n\\nDeclaration of competing interest\\n\\nMichael Liebrenz is the Editor in Chief of Forensic Science International: Mind and Law.

The first patient, an 87-year-old man became ill on February 19th and died on February 27th. The second patient, also male and 27 years old, became ill on February 27th and died on March 4th. In both cases there were fever, cough, and respiratory tract infection during the early stages of the illness. Five to ten days later, the patients developed severe pneumonia and progressive respiratory distress with lethal outcome.Following the guidelines of the nation-wide alert network for diagnosis of respiratory infectious diseases established in 2008, etiological studies were immediately carried out at the Laboratory of Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, which is one of the 16 sites selected for survey in the alert network. Blood, throat swabs and sputum samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction using primers for amplification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, new corona virus, and H5N1 influenza virus, which all yielded negative results. The only positive results were observed by using universal primers for amplification of influenza A viruses. To identify the viral subtype, the gene segments were subjected to further amplification, sequencing and blast analysis. The results showed that the hemagglutinin fragment showed high homology to influenza A virus H7 (94.8%) while the neuraminidase fragment was high homologue to influenza A virus N9 (94.2%). MP, NP, PA, PB1, PB2 showed 97%-99% homology with H9N2 virus. Specimens were sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation and H7N9 avian influenza viruses were isolated. China National Health and Family Planning Commission organized experts to do a comprehensive analysis based on the laboratory results, clinical manifestations of patients, epidemiological data, and concluded that the patients were infected with strains of H7N9 avian influenza virus. China National Health and Family Planning Commission notified the World Health Organization that a new H7N9 avian flu virus had caused lethal human infections in China (Gao RB et al., unpublished). Epidemiological survey revealed no H7N9 infection occurred among close contacts of the lethal cases. Both lethal cases had a history of contacts with pigs, but not with chickens. In contrast, some of the H7N9 cases observed subsequently in Jiangsu province had a history of slaughtering chickens. The municipal government of Shanghai has implemented stage III regulations for survey and control for fever and acute respiratory infections in all hospitals, and up to April 4th, fourteen cases with six deaths have been reported.Emerging viral diseases are a continuous threat to humans worldwide, and the majority of the emerging viruses originated from animal hosts. Of particular concern is the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans with or without pigs as intermediate hosts.Though such zoonotic transmissions are usually self-limited, they always pose a pandemic threat, since the viruses may adapt to humans. The avian influenza viruses that have occasionally infected and caused disease in people without showing human adaptation comprise H5N1, H9N2, and a variety of H7 viruses. 1,2 The H7 viruses isolated from humans include both highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian viruses. Whereas highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7 viruses may cause fatal disease in people, all human infections caused by low pathogenic H7 viruses so far had been mild. It is therefore concerning to see that the new H7N9 virus which, according to the available evidence, is derived from a low pathogenic avian virus can be lethal for man. However, it has to be emphasized that it is not clear yet whether the H7N9 virus is transmitted directly from birds or pigs to people. So far, this virus as an agent not causing disease in animals may escape detection in an animal reservoir more easily than the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. It is also not clear whether the current H7N9 human infection is a rare event, or the severe cases observed are just the tip of an iceberg of many asymptomatic human infections as has been suggested for H9N2 3 and H7N3 4 viruses.The identification of H7N9 virus as a cause of human disease is only the beginning of a long journey aimed at the elucidation of the epidemiology, the host range, and the pathogenicity of this virus, and at the development of efficient vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, adequate surveillance is the most important. The nation wide alert laboratory network established at 16 selected sites in China significantly contributed to the immediate identification of the emerging H7N9 virus, demonstrating that generous financial support from the government is necessary and fruitful. However, integrated surveillance of animal and human infections still needs to be improved. The barriers between physicians and veterinarians should be removed, and gaps should be filled between government agencies responsible for animal health (Ministry of Agriculture) and public health (Ministry of Health). While a close watch on H7N9 is going on in China, we expect that at the same time, basic research and international collaboration will be supported and encouraged.While writing this news, up to April 6th, the number of patients infected with H7N9 in mainland China has increased to 16, with six deaths, distributed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and all are in the eastern part of China. Only few patients had a history of contact with chickens. Among them, one is a four-year-old child with very mild respiratory infection symptoms but showed H9N7 positive by polymerase chain reaction in his throat swab. Currently in Shanghai and several other provinces, strict survey for H9N7 cases has been implemented in outpatients with fever and respiratory infections in all hospitals. At the same time survey for H9N7 among wild birds and poultries has been carried out by the animal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and confirmed by the National Key Laboratory of Avian Influenza Institute in Harbin. H7N9 isolates with high homology have been detected in pigeons from Songjiang district of Shanghai, and sanitary measures including slaughtering pigeons in that region and shutting down of markets trading live poultries in Shanghai have been implemented. Since this new virus is susceptible to antiviral drug oseltamivir, patients were treated with this drug as early as possible after the diagnosis.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Rapid diagnosis has been a challenge that may be amenable to molecular point-ofcare testing (POCT). Methods We performed a prospective observational study of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. There were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. The chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. Two nasal swabs were taken at the onset of symptoms. One swab was analysed within 45 min using a molecular POCT for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. After the Games, the other swab was tested for 16 possible causative respiratory viruses using PCR in laboratory-based testing. Results 20 out of 44 (45%) athletes and 22 out of 68 (32%) staff members experienced symptoms of the common cold during a median stay of 21 days. Eleven (26%) samples tested virus-positive using POCT. All subjects with influenza (n=6) and 32 close contacts were treated with oseltamivir. The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 75% of the athletes and 68 % of the staff members. Seven virus clusters were identified. They were caused by coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. The virus infections spread readily within the team, most commonly within the same sport discipline. Conclusions The cold was indeed a common illness in Team Finland during the Winter Olympic Games. POCT proved to be clinically valuable, especially for influenza. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in most cases.\\n\\n</td>\n",
              "      <td>InTROduCTIOn\\n\\nElite athletes are predisposed to the common cold due to heavy physical and mental stress which may suppress both innate and adaptive immunity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Air travel, human crowding, housing with other athletes and competition all increase the susceptibility of an elite athlete to the common cold. 6 The Winter Olympic Games take place during periods of low temperatures and its timing coincides with epidemics of many respiratory viruses. The common cold has been said to be 'the most dreaded opponent' at the Winter Olympic Games, and may ruin the athlete's long-term goal of success. 7 The common cold is a prevalent, complex and heterogeneous illness. 8 More than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist, and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies. 9 10 Signs and symptoms of different viral infections overlap, and it is not possible to identify the aetiological agent on clinical grounds alone. 11 12 Antiviral treatment is only available for influenza, but virus-specific preventive measures may reduce the transmission of illnesses. 13 14 The aim of our prospective observational study was to investigate the occurrence and aetiology of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. We used recently developed molecular multiplexed POCT for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus at the Games site. 15 16 After the Games, we used laboratory-based PCR testing to detect 16 possible causative respiratory viruses.\\n\\nStudy planning and participants\\n\\nThis prospective observational study was carried out during the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeong-Chang, South Korea between 26 January and 28 February 2018. During the Games, the temperature and humidity measured by Team Finland varied between −17°C and +8°C and between 12% and 77%, respectively. Monitoring of the common cold was provided to Team Finland members who stayed in the Olympic Village (45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members) and the two hotels outside the village (22 staff members) (figure 1). The mean age of the athletes (n=45) was 27 (SD 6) years and the mean age of the staff members (n=68) was 44 (SD 9). Thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female. The team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their Olympic trip, starting from their departure from Helsinki airport and finishing with their return to Helsinki airport, thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min. On their departure, all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion. The team members stayed in PyeongChang for a median length of 21 days (with a range of 10-32 days). They lived in groups of 5-6 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats. Figure 1 Flow chart of the study. More than one mucus sample was taken from 28 participants. Eleven POCT samples were not available for retesting in the laboratory. Due to lack of POCT reagents onsite, 12 samples were only tested in the laboratory. POCT, point-of-care testing. 1Total No. of tests performed including subjects tested more than once.\\n\\nOriginal article\\n\\nAll team members were instructed to immediately report symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection to the chief physician (MV), who stayed in the same building. At the onset of a symptom, two nasal mucus specimens (one from each nostril) were collected at a depth of 3-4 cm using flocked nasal swabs (503CS01, Copan Flock Technologies, Brescia, Italy). One specimen was used immediately for POCT and the other was refrigerated in a dry storage tube (553C, Copan Flock Technologies, Brescia, Italy) in the team's medical room. Swabs were also taken from subjects exposed to a patient with the common cold. Specimens for POCT were collected as part of the medical care of the team members.All study-related activities were conducted according to good clinical practice, which includes the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.Four athletes competed with mild symptoms of the common cold. One athlete competed 5 days after the onset of an influenza B infection, another competed 5 days after the onset of a respiratory syncytial virus A infection and two athletes competed five days after the onset of a metapneumovirus infection.\\n\\nAssessment of illness\\n\\nThe common cold was defined as the acute onset of any of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and cough. 8 In addition, fever (an axillary temperature ≥37.8°C), hoarseness and lethargy were recorded on a standardised form in the evening on a four-point severity scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe). 17 The total symptom score for the first 5 days of illness was calculated.\\n\\nMicrobiological studies\\n\\nA fast, automated POCT, the Cepheid Xpert Influenza+RSV Xpress Assay, was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 16 A nasal swab was suspended into 3 mL of universal transport medium (UTM, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) and 300 µL of suspension was added into the assay cartridge, which was then loaded into the Cepheid GeneXpert II instrument. After a processing time of 30 min, the test reading was recorded.For laboratory testing, stored specimens were suspended into 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. Nucleic acids were extracted from 500 µL aliquots of the suspended specimens with the MagNA Pure 96 System using a MagNA Pure 96 DNA Viral NA LV 2.0 kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the Pathogen Universal 500 3.1 protocol and an elution volume of 50 µL. The extracted nucleic acids were stored at −70°C between analyses. Allplex Respiratory Panels 1-4 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and the CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) instrument were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to detect respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, parainfluenza type 1-4 viruses, human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus using 8 µL of each specimen per panel. The AllPlex Respiratory Panel also detected the following bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A laboratory-designed triplex RT-PCR assay for influenza A, A/H1pdm09 and B viruses was performed as described earlier, with the exception that NxtScript DNA Master (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and Mic PCR instrument (Bio Molecular Systems, Upper Coomera, QLD, Queensland, Australia) were used for the PCR step. 18 In addition, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected using a triplex RT-PCR assay as described earlier, with the exception that Sensi-FAST Probe No-ROX kit (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany), and Mic PCR instrument were used for the PCR step. 19 A virus cluster was defined as three detections of the same virus during the median length of 3 weeks. This was considered an unusual aggregation event.\\n\\nStatistics\\n\\nThe difference between proportions was tested with a binomial standard normal deviation (SND) test and 95% CIs were calculated accordingly.\\n\\nOccurrence of the common cold\\n\\nForty-two out of 112 team members reported symptoms of respiratory infection during the study period of 10-32 days (median 21 days). There were 20 athletes (45%) and 22 (32%) staff members (p=0.123, 95% CI −5.2 to 31.2). Two athletes and two staff members suffered from a febrile illness. The mean duration of the symptoms was 8.3 (SD 7.8) days and 8.7 (SD 8.9) days in the athletes and the staff, respectively. One athlete and one staff member suffered from symptoms throughout their entire stay in the village (figure 2). Symptoms were mostly mild, and the mean total severity score was 6.4 (SD 5.9) for the athletes and 7.3 (SD 5.7) for the staff (table 1) . Only one athlete lost a competition on 1 day due to a respiratory infection.\\n\\nAetiology of the common cold detected by molecular POCT\\n\\nOnsite, the aetiology of respiratory infections was identified in 11 of 42 (26%) symptomatic cases. Before the Games, two cases of influenza B were detected by local healthcare services using antigen detection. POCT in the team's medical room detected one case of influenza A virus, three cases of influenza B virus and five cases of respiratory syncytial virus A. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in six athletes and in five staff members. All six patients with an influenza virus infection were treated with oseltamivir. Oseltamivir prophylaxis was given to their 32 contacts (11 athletes). None of them developed a symptomatic infection.\\n\\nAetiology of the common cold detected by multiplex-PCRtesting in the laboratory\\n\\nThe aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 30 figure 2 ). In five athletes and nine staff members (p=0.117), the PCR cycle threshold values were &lt;27, indicating high viral load (figure 2). In 8 out of 20 virus-positive cases, a previous or later nasal specimen was virus-negative. Nasal mucus samples were taken from 34 asymptomatic subjects due to close contact to a symptomatic subject. Eight samples were virus-positive (rhinovirus 3, coronavirus 229E 3, coronavirus NL63 2).Multiplexed PCR-testing for nasal bacteria identified H. influenzae in seven subjects and S. pneumoniae in two subjects. Co-detection with a respiratory virus was found in three out of nine cases. No cases of atypical bacteria were identified. Clinically no cases of probable bacterial infections were recorded.

All other POCT results were confirmed in the laboratory.\\n\\nTransmission of the common cold within the team\\n\\nOne subject reported nasal congestion when departing Finland. Respiratory syncytial virus A was detected at the Olympic Village. Six days later, the neighbouring team member in the aeroplane developed symptomatic respiratory syncytial virus A -infection. The next respiratory syncytial virus A cases were identified consequently 10, 16 and 17 days after the initial respiratory syncytial virus A detection.One subject developed a febrile influenza B infection during the 9-hour outbound flight. Another subject on the same flight (seated one row behind) developed an influenza B infection 1.5 days later. Three more subjects were infected with the influenza B virus. These cases were separate and were not known to be in contact with the earlier cases.One subject developed nasal congestion during the 9-hour flight, later detected to be a respiratory syncytial virus B infection. The subject was seated in business class and was isolated for 4 days in the Olympic Village. No other team member was infected with respiratory syncytial virus B.One subject reported a sore throat and mild lethargy 6 days after the departure. Metapneumovirus was detected. Metapneumovirus was detected in team members consequently 8, 13, 15 and 18 days after the initial metapneumovirus detection.Rhinovirus was detected in two samples from asymptomatic individuals 3 days and 4 days after their departure from Finland. One subject later arrived in the village with a symptomatic rhinovirus infection. One more subject developed nasal congestion in the village and one asymptomatic subject staying outside the village was predisposed to influenza B infection. In both cases, rhinovirus infection was later laboratory-confirmed. According to the incubation time and known contacts, the rhinovirus infections in the team were considered separate.Coronavirus 229E was detected in two subjects on February 13. The following cases were identified consequently 7, 8 (2 cases), 9 (4 cases) and 10 (2 cases) days after the initial detections. Three of these infections were asymptomatic. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in one subject 1 day after the subject departed Helsinki. Two further cases were identified 2 and 4 days after the initial case. Two asymptomatic coronavirus NL63 cases were identified on February 12. Two and one symptomatic subjects were detected 5 and 13 days later.Altogether seven virus clusters were identified. Four clusters (respiratory syncytial virus A, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and NL63) occurred within the same sport discipline (table 2) . Inter-disciplinary transmission was rare (data not shown).\\n\\ndISCuSSIOn\\n\\nWe discuss three main findings from this prospective observational study. First, 45% of the elite athletes and 32% of the staff members suffered from the symptoms of the common cold during the median stay of 3 weeks at the Winter Olympic Games. Second, POCT multiplex PCR diagnostics rapidly detected influenza A and B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections. Third, the probable aetiology of the common cold could be detected in 75% of the athletes and 68% of the staff members. Coronaviruses were the most common causative agents. Unexpectedly, clusters of seven respiratory viruses were found within the team.\\n\\nOccurrence of the common cold during the winter games\\n\\nTwo previous studies by the IOC reported 2% and 4% incidences of respiratory infections in elite athletes during the Vancouver 2010 and the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, respectively. 20 21 Our observation (45%) contrasts those observations. The IOC's reporting system may not be reliable because it is based on voluntary reporting by team physicians, who may not be properly informed within the team. At the onset of the Games, in our study, the team physician informed all team members about the monitoring of the common cold. She stayed in the same building as the team which allowed for daily encounters with the majority of team members. Even one symptom or mild symptoms were reported. 22 In agreement with our observations, 48% of 44 Norwegian cross-country skiers self-reported becoming ill during or 10 days immediately after the Tour de Ski. 23\\n\\nAetiology of the common cold in elite athletes\\n\\nOur study is the first to detect the aetiology of respiratory infections in elite athletes using molecular POCT at a major event. All available POCT virus diagnoses (positive and negative) were later confirmed at a laboratory. Diagnostics had clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections. In addition to early treatment with oseltamivir, POCT enabled effective post-contact oseltamivir prophylaxis for close contacts, for example, those living in the same accommodation or travelling on the same flight or in the same vehicle. 14 The isolation of infected team members was initiated after the onset of symptoms and continued for 3-4 days (ie, the most infectious period). [24] [25] [26] [27] We detected the probable causative virus in 75% of the elite athletes with the common cold. Causality is supported by a 4%-6% occurrence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults. 28 29 Only two earlier studies carried out in Australia in warm climate conditions have investigated the viral aetiology of acute respiratory symptoms in summer sport elite athletes. In one study the recovery rate was 29% and in the other it was 27%. 30 31 These low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation. Our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion. The virus recovery rate of 75% in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults. 9 10 A higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because PCR tests may detect only 50%-90% of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections. 13 32 The occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members. The difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes. It is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff (table 1) . Before and during the Winter Games, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in Finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in South Korea. The prevailing virus epidemics obviously contributed to the transmission of the infections.\\n\\nTransmission of the common cold\\n\\nIn three subjects, the symptoms of the common cold-one caused by influenza B virus and the others by respiratory syncytial virus A and B-developed during the 9-hour flight from Helsinki to Seoul. Two patients seemed to transmit the illness to another team member during the flight. Long-haul air travel is a wellknown risk factor for the transmission of contagious diseases. One person with influenza can transmit the infection to 5-10 people during an intercontinental flight. 33 Two cases of coronavirus OC43 infection were most probably travelling during the incubation period of the infection (3.5 days) and developed the illness within 2-3 days after arrival in the Olympic Village. 27 34 In addition, the first cases of rhinovirus and metapneumovirus infections were detected during the first week, suggesting that these infections also originated in Finland. 34 In addition to direct or indirect contact and droplets, respiratory viruses can spread via exhaled aerosols, even while talking. 35 36 Viruses may stay infectious on a surface for hours or days. The most commonly detected coronavirus 229E, stays infectious on common surfaces for at least 7 days. 37 Interestingly, it was recently shown that viruses can also spread through toilet flushing. 38 All subjects with influenza and close contact with individuals with influenza were treated with oseltamivir. ► In the laboratory the aetiology of the common cold was detected in 75% of the elite athletes. These athletes did not suffer from 'non-infectious airway inflammation in athletes'. ► Nine different respiratory viruses were detected, causing seven clusters of respiratory infections within the team. Coronaviruses were the most common viruses. Most viruses probably originated in Finland.\\n\\nhow might it impact on clinical practice in the future?\\n\\n► POCT diagnostics for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses should be made available at major sport events. POCT will improve the proper treatment, for example, targeted treatment of influenza, decrease unnecessary antibiotic treatment and enhance timely isolation to decrease viral transmission. ► The incidence of influenza virus infection reinforces the need for influenza vaccination in sport teams. ► At major sport events, healthcare providers should share information concerning detected respiratory virus infections to all teams to prevent an epidemics of respiratory viruses.housing with other athletes and the sport discipline (table 1) . Competition venues may be a favourable environment for virus transmission. Rigorous hand washing, the use of hand sanitisers, enhanced disinfection and strict patient isolation were likely to prevent the spread of viruses within the team but were apparently not very effective ( figure 2 ). This is due to the multifactorial transmission mechanisms of viral infections. 39\\n\\nStudy limitations\\n\\nThe number of subjects was small. Nasal swabs were planned to be taken from symptomatic subjects as part of normal healthcare. The prevalence and clinical significance of asymptomatic infections (eg, most coronavirus and influenza infections are asymptomatic) and prolonged virus shedding (ie, infectiousness) remains unclear. The POCT diagnostics detected only three respiratory viruses. 16 The 2018 influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were prominent, which may have increased our detection rate and affected the generalisability of the findings. Our study did not answer the question concerning the impact of a symptomatic or asymptomatic respiratory virus infection on an elite athlete's performance.\\n\\nCOnCluSIOnS\\n\\nMolecular POCT diagnostics proved clinically valuable. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in the majority of cases. The viruses were readily transmitted within the team. We believe comprehensive viral POCT is useful at major sporting events.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Abstract\\n\\nSmall RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21-to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3=-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.Citation Girardi E, Chane-Woon-Ming B, Messmer M, Kaukinen P, Pfeffer S. 2013.

              "      <td>IMPORTANCE In a continuous arms race, viruses have to deal with host antiviral responses in order to successfully establish an infection. In mammalian cells, the host defense mechanism relies on the recognition of viral RNAs, resulting in the activation of type I interferons (IFNs). In turn, the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is induced to inhibit viral replication. Here we report that the cytoplasmic, interferon-induced, cellular endoribonuclease RNase L is involved in the accumulation of a novel small RNA population of viral origin. These small RNAs are produced upon SINV infection of mammalian cells and are stabilized by a 3=-end modification. Altogether, our findings indicate that in our system RNA silencing is not active against Sindbis virus (SINV) and might open the way to a better understanding of the antiviral response mediated by a novel class of small RNAs.\\n\\ncontinuous arms race with their hosts, the outcome of which might ultimately result in either viral persistence, clearance of the viral infection, or death of the infected cells. The arsenal of antiviral defenses and viral counter defense mechanisms is vast and very diverse among the different phyla of life. Plants, insects, nematodes, and fungi mostly (if not exclusively) rely upon an innate immune response, whereas mammals have evolved an adaptive response in addition to this first line of defense. In the former organisms, the antiviral component of the innate immune response is mainly based on a highly conserved process commonly referred to as RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi). In this phenomenon, long double-stranded RNAs of viral origin are cleaved by the RNase Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then assembled into effector complexes that contain a member of the Argonaute (Ago) family; this results in targeted degradation of viral messenger or genomic RNAs (1) .In mammals, another type of innate immunity has evolved to control viruses (2) . The initial recognition of nonself viral nucleic acids by extra-and intracellular sensors triggers the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) (3) . This leads in turn to the upregulation of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (4) , which either directly trigger a signaling cascade directed against the viral infection or mobilize other cells of the immune system. ISGs encode proteins involved in apoptosis induction, protein synthesis blocking, or in the regulation of mRNA editing or RNA degradation (5) .One key factor involved in IFN type I-mediated host defense is RNase L, a latent cytoplasmic endoribonuclease that is activated by 2=,5=-oligoadenylates in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and that cleaves both viral and cellular RNAs (6) .Although extensive deep sequencing analyses have been performed to identify siRNAs in mammalian cells infected with several RNA viruses, there is so far no good evidence for a possible antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian somatic cells (7) . Nevertheless, another class of small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), has been shown to play an important role during viral infection in mammals. miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small RNAs derived from large primary transcripts, which are sequentially processed by the respective nuclear and cytoplasmic RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, to generate mature single-stranded~21-or 22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs (8, 9) . Similar to siRNAs, they are incorporated into an effector Ago-containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby they mediate posttranscriptional regulation of target mRNAs via partially complementary sites (10) . On one hand, miRNAs of cellular origin can directly or indirectly regulate viral infections (11, 12) . On the other hand, some viruses have evolved the capacity to encode their own miRNAs, which represent an ideal tool to stealthily modulate the cellular environment. To date, viral miRNAs have been almost exclusively identified in the genomes of DNA viruses, mostly herpesviruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , with the notable exception of bovine leukemia virus, a retrovirus with an RNA genome (18) . It has been commonly assumed that cytoplasmic RNA viruses cannot encode miRNAs, not only because they do not have access to the nuclear biogenesis machinery but also because their genomic integrity would be destabilized by miRNA processing (19) . Nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that the insertion of a cellular miRNA precursor into the 3=-end nontranslated region (NTR) of Sindbis virus (SINV) genomic RNA leads to its cytoplasmic processing without affecting the viral replication (20, 21) .The arthropod-borne SINV is a small, enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus and is the prototype for the alphavirus genus. Alphaviruses represent a group of widely distributed human and animal pathogens, which pose a serious public health threat (22) . Some of them induce febrile and arthritogenic diseases, while others can cause highly debilitating diseases, such as encephalitis. The SINV genomic RNA is capped and polyadenylated and is infectious as naked RNA. Upon entry into the cytoplasm by endocytosis, the host translational machinery recognizes the genomic RNA, and four nonstructural proteins are produced (23) . Their expression is sufficient for the establishment of replication complexes and the synthesis of a complementary antigenomic negative RNA strand. The antigenome is necessary for the replication of the viral genome and the production of a subgenomic RNA that ensures the translation of the structural proteins during the late phase of infection (24, 25) .To date, SINV has not been shown to give rise to any small RNA species in mammalian cells. As such, we decided to investigate the small RNA profile of SINV-infected human and African green monkey cell lines. Using small RNA cloning and deep sequencing techniques, we provide evidence that the SINV genome is a source of small RNAs in infected mammalian cells. Some of these small RNAs accumulate to levels detected by Northern blot analysis. We set out to identify the factors involved in their biogenesis and show that they do not depend on the RNA silencing machinery, but rather, that they are downstream products of the cytoplasmic IFN-induced endoribonuclease RNase L. Finally, we also present experimental evidence that these viral small RNAs are modified at their 3= extremity. Altogether, our results indicate that the SINV-derived small RNAs could represent key markers of the host defense mechanism.\\n\\nSINV-derived small RNAs accumulate in infected mammalian cells.\\n\\nIn order to investigate the presence and nature of virusderived small RNAs in mammalian cells, we used a small RNA cloning and deep sequencing approach. We generated and analyzed small RNA libraries from both HEK293 and Vero cells infected with SINV or not infected with SINV.Total RNA was isolated from uninfected cells or cells infected with SINV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 plaque forming units (PFU) per cell 16 h postinfection (hpi). Using these conditions, we could detect cells with a high viral load without observing any apparent cell death as assessed by propidium iodide staining (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We also confirmed that until 24 hpi, cells were still actively proliferating (data not shown). High-throughput sequencing yielded 201,793 and 1,193,893 reads that mapped to the SINV genome in infected HEK293 and Vero cells, respectively (Fig. 1A) ; these two numbers of reads represented a percentage of 1.66 and 7.99%, respectively, of total mapped small RNAs in HEK293 and Vero cells. The greater fraction of viral reads in Vero cells is consistent with the fact that these cells are known to be more permissive to viral infections due to a defect in interferon production (26) . The distribution of the reads on the viral genomic (positive) and antigenomic (negative) strands is indicated in Fig. 1A . Interestingly, the vast majority of the reads (98 to 99%) originate from the genomic strand of the virus. Nonetheless, we identified limited sequencing reads that were derived from the negative strand, albeit at extremely low levels in both libraries (Fig. 1A) . Their genomic distribution showed a peak at the 3= end of the antigenome (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). This specific region corresponds to the viral promoter, necessary for the replication of the viral genome and is known to fold into a conserved 44-nt stemloop structure (25) . The length distribution of the antigenomic small RNA reads peaked at a size of 22 nt (Fig. S2B) , which corresponds to the 5= arm of the stem-loop structure (Fig. S2C ). Although we could validate the presence of the 44-nt-long RNA by Northern blot analysis, we were unable to detect the accumulation of the small 22-nt RNA as a discrete species (Fig. S2D) .The size distribution of the main population of viral reads mapping on the positive strand of the virus was broad with no defined peak at a specific length (Fig. 1B) . However, a closer inspection revealed that the overall size and genomic distribution of the viral reads were highly similar in both HEK293 and Vero cells (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, a greater number of reads were found between nucleotides 7000 and 11700 of the viral genome, corresponding to the abundantly expressed subgenomic RNA.We selected 14 candidates among the most abundant peaks obtained in both cell types for validation by Northern blot analysis (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). We could detect several SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) of 20 to 30 nt in length that were derived from all along the viral genome (Fig. S3B ). Among them, SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 were detected in both HEK293 and Vero cells (Fig. S3C) . The presence of abundant larger bands accumulating between 40 and 100 nt was also evidenced. Of note, the expression of both larger and smaller viral RNAs increased proportionally to the accumulation of the viral genome during a time course of infection ( Fig. 1D and E) . The identification of SINV-derived small RNAs prompted us to analyze more closely their origin and biochemical properties.The production of SvsRNAs does not rely on the miRNA biogenesis machinery. The identification of small RNAs from RNA viruses could be seen either as a result of a productive mechanism for the pathogen (as for virus-encoded miRNAs) or as the consequence of a host response to control the infection by degrading viral RNAs. SINV expresses four enzymes that play key functions during the viral replicative cycle. However, none of these enzymes is known to possess an endoribonuclease activity (22) that could enable the processing of small RNAs from a viral RNA precursor. Therefore, cellular enzymes have to be involved in the biogenesis of SINV sRNAs. In order to identify them, we decided to knock down cytoplasmic enzymes with a known RNase activity. We first focused on proteins important for the production of small RNAs, such as miRNAs. Hence, we transfected siRNAs against Drosha, Dicer, or Ago2 followed by an infection with SINV and an analysis of viral small RNA accumulation. Although Drosha is known to be mostly nuclear, we also took it into consideration because it was recently shown to relocalize to the cytoplasm upon SINV infection (21) . Although we were able to downregulate very efficiently Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2 (see Fig. S4A to C in the supplemental material), the knockdown of these factors neither affected the viral load nor the accumulation of SvsRNA-1, -2 and -3 ( Fig. S4D to G). We also examined whether we could detect an siRNA signature among all viral reads by looking for small RNAs that could perfectly base pair on 19 or 20 nt and present a 2-nt overhang in 3=. A very limited number of such duplexes could be found, but they were not more represented than larger duplexes presenting with 3= or 5= overhangs (data not shown). It has been reported that small RNAs, which are not generated by Dicer or Drosha cleavage, could nevertheless be assembled into Argonaute proteins (e.g., tRNA fragments [27] ). We therefore immunoprecipitated Argonaute proteins followed by Northern blot analysis to see whether SvsRNAs could be detected within the RISC. However, although we could detect the accumulation of the cellular miRNA miR-16, using both an antibody specific for Ago2 (Fig. S4H , left panel) and an antibody able to recognize all four Ago proteins (Fig. S4H , right panel), we were unable to detect SvsRNAs within immunoprecipitated RISC.RNase L is involved in the production of SvsRNAs. We then hypothesized that an endoribonuclease involved in the antiviral response could be implicated in SvsRNA production. RNase L is a ubiquitous, cytoplasmic, interferon-induced endonuclease that plays a key role in the cellular response to viral infections. It cleaves single-stranded RNA regions after the dinucleotides UA/UU, thereby preventing virus accumulation (28) . As such, we knocked down RNase L using siRNAs, before infecting the cells with SINV. As expected, RNase L knockdown (KD) resulted in the upregulation of the SINV genome by approximately 2.5-fold ( Fig. 2A and  B) . Interestingly, it also resulted in a dramatic reduction of the viral small RNAs SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 and their precursors (Fig. 2C) .In order to extend this observation and assess the role of RNase L in SvsRNA generation, we also produced small RNA libraries from HEK293 cells treated with a control or an RNase L-specific siRNA prior to SINV infection. In accordance with the striking effect seen on the three specific SvsRNAs, reduction in RNase L protein level decreased the entire population of clonable viral sequences from 2.75 to 1.19% (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). However, RNase L knockdown affected neither the size distribution of viral reads nor their genomic distribution ( Fig. S5B and C).Given the cleavage properties of RNase L (see next section), it was unlikely that the identified small RNAs were direct products of this enzyme. We therefore looked for other factors implicated in RNA degradation that could affect SvsRNA accumulation. We used RNAi to downregulate the expression of the major cytoplasmic 5=-3= exoribonuclease Xrn1 (Fig. 2D ). As expected, the capped viral genome was not affected by downregulation of Xrn1 (Fig. 2E) . However, the levels of SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 and their precursors were stabilized (Fig. 2F) . We then looked at the effect of combining knockdown of these factors (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). We found that the double knockdown of both RNase L and Dicer did not affect the accumulation of SvsRNA-1 compared to the single RNase L knockdown, which confirms that Dicer does not play a role (Fig. S6A) . On the contrary, the accumulation of SvsRNA-1 upon double knockdown of both RNase L and Xrn1 increased compared to the single RNase L knockdown (Fig. S6A ). This finding suggests that both RNase L and Xrn1 can act upon viral RNAs and have opposite activities in terms of generation and stabilization of the SvsRNAs. Xrn1 might act upstream of RNase L in degrading, for example, uncapped viral RNAs that would otherwise be a substrate for RNase L; alternatively, it could directly act upon the RNase L products. The former hypothesis is more likely though because Xrn1 has a preference for 5= phosphorylated RNAs, whereas RNase L leaves a 5= OH after cleavage. We also performed a high-molecular-weight Northern blot analysis to look at the effects of the various knockdowns on the accumulation of the genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs.The results confirm the quantitative PCR data, in that only the RNase L KD has an impact on the accumulation of both genomic and subgenomic RNAs (Fig. S6B) .We also tested several cytoplasmic 3=-5= exoribonucleases, including DIS3L, DIS3L2, and Rrp40 (also known as EXOSC3, a core subunit of the exosome); knockdown of these factors had no effect on SvsRNA accumulation (data not shown). This indicated that at least the main cytoplasmic 3=-5= exoribonucleases do not seem to be implicated in the production of the viral small RNAs.The 3= extremity of SvsRNA-1 is modified. RNase L processing produces a typical signature: the enzyme leaves a 5= hydroxyl (OH) and a 3= phosphate (P) after cleavage (6) . However, these features are not compatible with our small RNA cloning protocol (29) , which strictly relies on the presence of a 5= P and a 3= OH on the small RNA extremities. This prompted us to characterize the extremities of SvsRNAs to better understand their biogenesis. We initially decided to restrict our analysis to SvsRNA-1 because it accumulated as a major form of 23 nt. The assay used for the analysis of RNA 5= ends involved digestion with the Terminator exonuclease, a processive 5=-3= exonuclease that specifically targets and degrades RNAs with a 5= monophosphate, but not RNAs with 5= triphosphates, 5= OH, or a 5= CAP (30) .For a control, the Terminator reaction was carried out on both a 5= OH and a 5= P oligoribonucleotide with the same sequence as SvsRNA-1. Terminator treatment did not result in the degradation of the 5= OH synthetic oligoribonucleotide, whereas the 5= P RNA oligonucleotide was almost completely degraded. Accordingly, SvsRNA-1 is prone to degradation by the Terminator exonuclease, which is consistent with the presence of a monophosphate at the 5= end, while the accumulation of the precursor bands was less affected by the treatment (Fig. 3A) .Next, we performed sodium periodate (NaIO 4 ) treatment followed by ␤-elimination to specifically examine the 3= end of SvsRNA-1. The presence of hydroxyl groups in positions 2= and (B and E) SINV genomic RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR, before and after RNase L or Xrn1 KD. The relative quantification is normalized to GAPDH levels and is represented on a logarithmic scale as a mean of three replicates. (C and F) Northern blot analysis on total RNA from infected HEK293 cells before and after RNase L or Xrn1 KD. U6 was used as a normalizer.3= on the last ribose is needed for the periodate reaction. ␤-elimination of the oxidized RNA results in an RNA product one or two nucleotides shorter. On the contrary, the presence of modifications on the ribose of the 3= terminal residue renders the RNA insensitive to periodate oxidation and impairs the chain scission (31) . For a control for the reaction, we measured its effect on the unmodified cellular miRNA miR-16. As expected, the electrophoretic mobility of the miRNA strongly changed after treatment (Fig. 3B) . In contrast, SvsRNA-1 mobility was found to be insensitive to periodate oxidation and ␤-elimination (Fig. 3B) . This indicated the presence of a modification on the terminal ribose, most likely in the 2= position, which is perfectly compatible with our cloning protocol. Interestingly, it also seems that the intermediate RNA products are insensitive to periodate oxidation and are consequently modified (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). Moreover, we were also able to assess the existence of a modified 3= end for other SvsRNAs by Northern blotting (Fig. S8) .In order to gain more insight into the nature of this modification, we treated our samples with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 , and 16) prior to ␤-elimination (Fig. 3C, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16) . The double treatment strongly affected the mobility of a control oligoribonucleotide with a 3= P (Fig. 3C, lane 4) , while the mobility of the 3= OH oligonucleotide was affected independently of the CIP treatment (Fig. 3C, lanes 7  and 8) . Of note, the combined reactions changed neither the mobility of a control oligoribonucleotide bearing a CIP-insensitive modification (methyl group in position 2= of the last ribose) (Fig. 3C, lane 12) nor the mobility of SvsRNA-1 (Fig. 3C, lane 16) .Taken together, these results show that SvsRNA-1 is modified at its 3= extremity but that the modification is not due to a monophosphate group caused by a direct RNase L cut.Viral genomic RNA is modified on A 8333 . The presence of posttranscriptional modifications, such as 2=-O-methylation, is a characteristic of several cellular RNAs in mammals, such as rRNAs (32) , snRNAs (33) , and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) (34, 35) .Recently, it has also been reported for several viruses that their genomic RNA can be 2=-O-methylated at specific positions (36, 37) . We hypothesized that the modification on the small RNA could be derived from a modification at the level of the genomic RNA, which is reasonable given the fact that SvsRNA-1 precursor RNAs also appear to be modified (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). We thus looked for modifications in the genomic region spanning SvsRNA-1 using the RTL-P (reverse transcription at low deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations followed by polymerase chain reaction) technique (38) : the tendency of the reverse transcriptase to pause immediately before a 2=-Omethylated nucleotide is exploited to establish the efficiency of retrotranscription by semiquantitative PCR, using differential deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentrations.As shown in Fig. 4A , we designed a reverse transcription primer specific for the viral genome, as well as primers for semiquantitative PCR in the region surrounding SvsRNA-1 (shown in red): one reverse primer (R) and three forward primers, upstream (F U ) or downstream of the putative modification (F D1 and F D2 ). After retrotranscription with low and high dNTP concentrations, we performed multiplex PCR using primers F U /F D1 (in the SvsRNA-1 region) or primers F D1 /F D2 (in the control region) and then compared the signal intensity ratios of PCR products amplified with different numbers of PCR cycles (Fig. 4B ). Our data indicated that only the F U /F D1 ratio changed depending on the RT conditions (Fig. 4B, top panel) , suggesting that at a low dNTP concentration, the reverse transcriptase paused in the SvsRNA-1 region, most probably due to the presence of a modification on the viral genome in the region of interest.To further strengthen this observation and to identify the precise position of the nucleotide modification, we performed primer extension assays on RNA isolated from either SINV-infected HEK293 or Vero cells (Fig. 4C ). 2=-O-methylation can cause reverse transcriptase to pause one nucleotide before and/or at the O-methylated nucleotide. Indeed, we identified two bands (RT stops) that correspond to nucleotides G 8334 and A 8333 , the latter corresponding precisely to the 3= end of the SvsRNA-1 sequence (Fig. 4C) .These data imply that the 3=-end modification of SvsRNA-1 was likely already present on the viral genome and might be a 2=-O-methylation.3=-end modification is a hallmark of SvsRNAs. Taken together, our observations indicate that the SINV genomic RNA is modified, and are therefore suggestive of a potential modification of SvsRNAs. We then decided to investigate to what extent reads mapping to the SINV genome were modified at the last nucleotide position. Small RNA libraries were prepared from noninfected or SINV-infected HEK293 cells using total RNA treated (or not) with NaIO 4 . This treatment specifically impairs the 3= adapter ligation to RNA species with unmodified 3= ends (2= and 3= OH), while RNAs bearing a modification at one of these positions are resistant to oxidation, and can therefore be ligated. Overnight ligation of the 3= adapter at 16°C was performed in order to enhance the cloning of 2=-O modified small RNAs (39) .After deep sequencing of these libraries, we mapped the total number of reads against both the human and SINV genome (Table 1). As expected, in both noninfected and infected cells, the NaIO 4 treatment drastically reduced the number of clonable miRNA sequences (see also Fig. S9A in the supplemental material). In contrast, modified small RNAs (such as tRNA fragments) were preferentially cloned over miRNAs upon NaIO 4 treatment (Fig. S9B) . Strikingly, almost 75% of the viral reads were kept after oxidation ( Table 1 ). The oxidation treatment did not dramatically change the genomic distribution of the viral reads compared to the nontreated sample (Fig. 5A) . However, deep sequencing revealed some new peaks (Fig. 5A, arrows) that we could also validate by ␤-elimination and Northern blot analysis (see SvsRNA-15 and -16 in Fig. S8) .The size distribution of the viral reads remained unchanged before and after NaIO 4 treatment, indicating that SINV-derived modified RNAs belonged to each length (Fig. 5B) . Finally, we analyzed the nucleotide composition of the 3= end of SINV small RNAs and observed that we had enrichment in adenosine (A) at the 3= end after oxidation, which was not clearly discernible in the nontreated sample (Fig. 5C ). This is in line with the specific 2=-Omethylation occurring on internal adenosines recently identified on the genome of dengue virus (36) .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nMammals have evolved a very sophisticated innate immune response to ward off pathogens that is based on the sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by dedicated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). When it comes to viral infection, one of the most potent PAMPs is dsRNA. The recognition of dsRNA by PRRs triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the activation of interferon-sensitive genes (ISGs) (40) . RNA silencing is another type of antiviral innate immunity, which, as of now, has mostly been demonstrated in plant and insect organisms (1). Nonetheless, a role for RNA silencing as a host defense system against mammalian viruses could reasonably be considered. Indeed, Dicer, the key enzyme for dsRNA cleavage is conserved in higher vertebrates, and although its main substrate in vivo is pre-miRNA molecules, it is able to process long dsRNA into short RNAs in vitro (41) . However, the question as to which other types of dsRNA molecules mammalian Dicer can cleave in vivo has been the matter of intense research, and especially so when considering RNAs of viral origin. Here, we wanted to make our contribution to the field by studying the prototypical arbovirus, Sindbis virus. This type of virus can infect both insects and mammals, and as such is a useful tool to study the conservation of antiviral mechanisms in both phyla. Intriguingly, it has been shown for some members of the alphavirus genus that their genomic RNA can be processed into both siRNAs and piRNAs in insect somatic cells (42, 43) .In this study, we generated small RNA libraries from two different mammalian cell lines infected with SINV. Although the percentage of sequences mapping to the viral genome was significant (~1.7 to~8% in HEK293 and Vero cells, respectively), we were unable to detect either siRNA or piRNA signatures. On the contrary, the viral reads displayed a highly biased strand distribution. Although antigenomic (negative) strand-derived sequences represented a very small percentage of the total viral reads, they showed properties distinct from the genomic (positive) strand reads: their size distribution peaked at 22 nt, and their localization on the viral genome is restricted to the promoters required for the synthesis of both the genomic and subgenomic RNA. Although the cloned 22-nt sequences were not visible by Northern blot analysis, we could detect the accumulation of an~44-nt product that in our knowledge has never been observed before. We hypothesize that these RNA species could be critical for viral replication, similarly to what has been previously reported for influenza virus (44) .Consistent with the relative abundance of the positive strand compared to the negative strand, the majority of reads were derived from the plus-strand RNA and more specifically from the region corresponding to the subgenomic RNA sequence. We could detect several hot spots of small RNA accumulation, indicating that discrete SINV-derived viral small RNA species (SvsR-NAs) could be produced in infected mammalian cells. These Svs-RNAs do not display any peak in size distribution and do not map to any alphavirus conserved regions. Nonetheless, we noticed that they originate from the same viral genomic positions in both infected African green monkey and human cells. In order to confirm that this was not solely due to a bias in the small RNA cloning protocol, we performed Northern blot analyses of several small RNA candidates. For some of the candidates, we were able to detect discrete bands, which increased in intensity throughout the time course of infection.We therefore focused on the characterization of the positivestrand-derived small RNAs. One hypothesis regarding their identity could be that some of these SvsRNAs are in fact virus-encoded miRNAs. Using bioinformatics tools such as miRDeep2 (45, 46) and miRanalyzer2 (47, 48) , we excluded the possibility that putative miRNA precursor structures were present in the viral genome. Nonetheless, we tested whether the miRNA machinery was required for the production of viral small RNAs by knocking down Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2. The downregulation of these factors affected neither SINV replication nor accumulation of the three most abundant identified SvsRNAs, indicating that their production must involve another RNase. We discovered that the RNase L endonuclease is implicated in SvsRNA genesis. Indeed, its downregulation causes a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of Sindbis viral small RNAs detected by Northern blot analysis; this is accompanied by an upregulation of the viral genomic RNA. In order to extend this observation, we also generated small RNA libraries from HEK293 cells treated with siRNAs against RNase L and infected with SINV. We found that, under these conditions, the global population of SINV sRNAs was downregulated. RNase L is an endoribonuclease that is present in the cell in the form of an inactive monomer. Upon type I interferon induction, and more specifically 2=-5= oligoadenylate synthetase activation (6) , it can dimerize and then act upon its viral RNA targets. RNase L is known to play an antiviral role against viruses such as West Nile virus (49), hepatitis C virus (50) , and SINV (51) . We also looked at the involvement of exoribonucleases in the production of SvsRNAs and found that, indeed, the accumulation of these small RNAs is counteracted by the cellular 5=-3= exonuclease Xrn1. This suggests that SvsRNAs represent stable viral products of cellular decay enzymes. We therefore hypothesize that RNase L is the enzyme primarily involved in the generation of small RNAs and that the further processing operated by other uncharacterized enzymes could give rise to the final 20-to 30-nt-long viral RNAs. It also remains possible that some of the fragments we detected are direct products of RNase L but are further modified by kinases and dephosphorylases, which would allow their cloning.The fact that RNA fragments generated by RNase L are detected implies that some of them must be stabilized. Indeed, we discovered that the viral small RNA candidates appear to be modified on the 3= proximal nucleotide. We could extend this peculiarity to the global small RNA population by cloning and sequencing small RNAs after an oxidation treatment designed to prevent ligation of nonmodified RNAs. Our data indicate that this modification is most likely a 2=-O-methylation and seems to occur at the level of the viral genomic RNA, preferentially on adenosines. Thanks to a double approach of RTL-P and primer extension, we were able to map such a modification on position A 8333 of the SINV viral genome. Moreover, our sequencing data indicate that there are most likely many others given the enrichment in A residues at the 3= end of small RNAs cloned after oxidative treatment.The main protective mechanism against 3=-5= degradation is a 2=-O-methylation on the 3= proximal ribose, which prevents degradation by exoribonucleases and thus helps to stabilize small RNAs such as miRNAs and siRNAs in plants, piRNAs in animals, and siRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster (52) . This suggests that RNA modification could have evolved as a response to protect the anti-pathogen small RNAs during infections. Posttranscriptional RNA modifications represent an important but not yet fully understood system to regulate transcripts. Cellular RNAs contain many distinct posttranscriptional modifications at thousands of sites. In the same way, RNA viruses take advantage of nucleoside modifications on the base or on the ribose of their genomic RNA (36, 53) as a host mimicry strategy to abrogate innate immune signaling (54) .The enzyme responsible for the methylation of SINV RNA remains unknown. However, it has been reported that the alphavirus nsP2 protein contains a putative methyltransferase (MT)-like domain, similar to dengue virus NS5 MTase (55) . Although the activity of this domain has not been verified yet, nsP2-MTase mutant viruses exhibit a strong phenotype: negative-strand synthesis is continuous, and unstable viral replication complexes are produced. Surprisingly, RNase L-deficient cells infected with SINV display the same phenotype, suggesting that the two proteins function in similar events (55) . For all these reasons, we propose that RNase L-dependent, 3=-modified small RNAs from SINV could be involved as intermediates in this mechanism.Altogether, our findings show a link between the host degradation pathway and stabilization of modified viral small RNAs. Clearly, not all the small RNAs identified by our deep sequencing approach correspond to RNase L downstream products. Nonetheless, the fact that at least some of these small RNAs are protected and detected might implicate them in signaling events, maybe upstream of the infection front, which might prove difficult to assess in cell culture. We hypothesized that by removing RNase L we might uncover signatures corresponding to other types of small RNAs, such as siRNAs or piRNAs, but it did not turn out to be the case. This could be due to the fact that other enzymes might also be involved in the production of RNA fragments and is an indication that it will make the detection of antiviral RNAi complicated in differentiated mammalian cells. An alternate hypothesis could also be that SINV encodes an RNA silencing suppressor that blocks Dicer activity but has no effect on RNase L. Finally, it is also possible that the antiviral RNAi response might be detected only in specific subtypes of cells in mammals, which would be different from the differentiated somatic cells we used for our study. Further investigation will be needed to answer these questions and to decipher the roles played by this type of virusderived small RNAs, as well as their potential implication in the design of new antiviral therapeutic strategies.\\n\\nViral stocks, cell culture, and virus infection.\\n\\nPlasmid carrying wild-type (WT) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SINV genomic sequence (kindly provided by M. C. Saleh) was linearized with XhoI and used as a substrate for in vitro transcription using mMESSAGE mMACHINE capped RNA transcription kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sindbis viral stock was prepared in BHK21 hamster kidney cells, and titers were measured by plaque assay. HEK293 and Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Clontech) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37°C. Cells were infected with SINV at an MOI of 0.01. Samples were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h postinfection (hpi).RNAi-mediated protein depletion. For siRNA transfection, 0.4 ϫ 10 5 HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Transfections were carried out for 72 h using 20 nM ON-TARGET plus Smart Pool siRNAs (Dharmacon) for one-step depletion (human RNase L and Xrn1) or 100 nM ON-TARGET plus Smart Pool siRNAs (Dharmacon) for two-step depletion (human Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The ON-TARGET plus Nontargeting Pool siRNAs (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Cells were infected with SINV and harvested after 16 h for RNA and protein analysis.Small RNA cloning and sequencing. RNA was extracted from noninfected and SINV-infected HEK293 and Vero cells 16 hpi. Small RNA cloning was conducted with 10 or 20 g of total RNA as previously described (14, 29) . Small RNA libraries from SINV-infected HEK293 cells treated with control or RNase L-specific siRNAs were generated following the same protocol with some modifications. Mainly, small RNAs were ligated using degenerate 5= and 3= adapters to limit biases in the ligation step (56) . This procedure was also used to prepare small RNA libraries after NaIO 4 treatment of 100 g of total RNA, as previously described (57) , except that the 3= ligation was performed at 16°C overnight, in 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) to favor the cloning of modified small RNAs. Sequencing was performed at the IGBMC Microarray and Sequencing platform, Illkirch, France, using different Illumina instruments (Genome Analyzer IIx, HiSeq 2000, and HiSeq 2500) with a read length of 36 or 50 bp.A detailed description of the deep sequencing data analysis is available in Text S1 in the supplemental material.Microarray data accession number.

              "      <td>Abstract\\n\\nThe twentieth century was marked by extraordinary advances in our understanding of microbes and infectious disease, but pandemics remain, food and waterborne illnesses are frequent, multidrug-resistant microbes are on the rise, and the needed drugs and vaccines have not been developed. The scientific approaches of the past-including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology-have not been sufficient to address these challenges. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods. These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions. To take full advantage of these innovations, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently initiated the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. As participants of the Systems Biology Program, we think that the time is at hand to redefine the pathogen-host research paradigm.\\n\\n</td>\n",
              "      <td>\\n\\nI nfectious diseases continue to be major health concerns worldwide: hepatitis C, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) are ongoing pandemics. A third of the world population is currently infected with the TB bacillus; millions of people are infected by influenza virus annually; and even though therapeutic drugs have slowed the threat of HIV-1, there is still no definitive cure or viable vaccine in sight. Although influenza virus vaccines provide protection, they must be reformulated annually, and the time lag from the spread of a pandemic virus to the availability of a vaccine is far too long. A universal vaccine against influenza virus is needed to limit high levels of morbidity and mortality. Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, avian H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and dengue fever are a constant threat; and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella outbreaks in the food industry, are costly to society.New research strategies and tactics must be employed to minimize these threats and improve global health. In response to this need, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has sponsored the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. This program consists of four centers, each with its own unique focus on a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens (Fig. 1) . In this perspective, we discuss why the time is right for applying a systems biology approach to infectious disease research and how we are implementing this approach to overcome specific obstacles. This venture requires a new way of thinking about how best to address the challenges of infectious disease research.\\n\\nDEFINING SYSTEMS BIOLOGY\\n\\nIntrinsic to systems biology is the notion that biological systems have \"emergent properties\": that is, their sum is greater than their individual parts, and the biological outcomes of a system cannot be predicted by traditional reductionist methods that study only the individual components (1) . Instead, an understanding of bio-logical systems requires the integration of high-throughput multiomics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, etc.), which are used to construct predictive models of the networks and dynamic interactions between the biological components of the complex pathogen-host system (2) . Through iterative rounds of model development, testing, and filling in the gaps with experimental data, models are refined to provide predictions that can ultimately be used to help identify therapeutic targets and improve clinical outcomes. This iterative cycle of perturbation biology is key to the systems biology approach (Fig. 2 ) and requires the establishment of efficient interdisciplinary collaborations, the building of integrated computational infrastructures, and the generation of self-consistent, comprehensive, and modelspecific experimental data (3) .The technologies, computational methods, and genome information needed to successfully implement this approach now exist. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing have opened the door to sequencing total transcriptomes, encompassing mi-croRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and mRNAs. This has raised the possibility that a previously unappreciated class of RNAs-the long noncoding RNAs-may play important roles in the host response to virus infection (4) . Proteomic technologies and accompanying informatics pipelines are evolving rapidly, with throughput and sensitivity approaching that of microarrays. Metabolomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and phosphoproteomics are young and comparatively undeveloped, but the promise is unlimited and the potential unprecedented. Moreover, the appropriate in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to generate useful pathogen-host interaction models are now available. Each of the four NIAID Systems Biology Centers has taken a unique approach to implementing this new research paradigm as outlined below.\\n\\nNIAID SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CENTERS\\n\\nThe TB Systems Biology Center (http://www.broadinstitute.org /annotation/tbsysbio) at Stanford is using cell culture models, together with a combination of biochemical and transcriptional profiling methods, to characterize the state of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus and the host at each stage of its infectious cycle and during transitions between stages. Each of the three stages is orchestrated by a distinct genetic program that directs the expression of stage-specific antigens and the activation of stage-specific metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. There is an unusually close interaction between the pathogen and the host immune system, which depending on the outcome of this interaction, can lead to a stable, inactive, and asymptomatic infection that is compatible with a normal life span (latency) or to rapid destruction of lung tissue and death (reactivation disease). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is one of the key technologies used to identify the regulatory networks that govern these transitions. Incorporation of these data with results from multidimensional assays that interrogate the status of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and metabolites will lead to the construction of predictive models useful in the development of stage-specific therapeutics (8) .The Systems Virology Center (http://www.systemsvirology .org) at the University of Washington is comprehensively analyzing and modeling the molecular and cellular events, pathogenhost interactions, and cellular response networks induced or altered during the course of respiratory virus infection. This research focuses on highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For each virus, the host response to highly pathogenic wild-type viruses and to engineered viruses with reduced levels of pathogenicity is being analyzed and modeled. These studies use cell culture infection systems, which are the most amenable systems for computation modeling, as well as mouse and macaque infection models. Animal models enable the incorporation of disease-relevant complexity and the validation, extension, and refinement of findings obtained from cell culture systems. Designing and performing experiments so that comparisons can be made across the model systems are an integral but labor-intensive part of the process. The direct communication between biologists and modelers-constant within all of the Systems Biology Centersensures that the experimental designs are suitable in terms of biological sample size, reproducibility, and consistency from highthroughput assays to construction of predictive models and the resulting biological interpretations. The question remains as to whether current computational and modeling techniques are robust enough to generate relevant models given the complexities of these systems. However, only by attempting these types of studies will the required methodologies be developed. \\n\\nPerspective\\n\\nThe Center for Systems Influenza (http://www .systemsinfluenza.org) at the Institute for Systems Biology is using multi-omics approaches to compare the responses of both in vitro and in vivo systems to infection with influenza virus strains of various pathogenicities. The devastating mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic was characterized by both a dysregulated innate immune response and a high susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonias. Computational integration of the transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipidomic data into an appropriate network model will illuminate the detailed signatures of extreme virulence and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses. These studies are being extended to identify and model those hostvirus interactions that predispose an infected lung to secondary bacterial invasion by Staphylococcus aureus. A comprehensive model of the influenza virus-host interaction, aided significantly by recent advances in sequencing technologies and advances in viral genetic manipulation, will serve to calibrate the global public health response to a newly emergent strain as well as uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.The Center for Systems Biology for EnteroPathogens (http: //www.sysbep.org/) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is using regulatory and metabolic modeling, empowered by multiomics data, to characterize the interactions between the host and distantly related bacterial pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Yersinia species. Salmonella is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague. As general models of infection, Salmonella and Yersinia pestis are among the best characterized with in vitro and in vivo animal models. These bacterial pathogens must use a well-orchestrated series of regulatory and metabolic changes to replicate and persist in the inhospitable host environment. Among these highly regulated processes is the process of secreting bacterial proteins into the host that modulate the host's response network. Early efforts have focused on developing methods to investigate and model the coordinated regulatory and metabolic changes occurring in the pathogen during infection and to identify and characterize the secreted bacterial proteins responsible for manipulating the host networks (5, 6) . Understanding the regulatory and metabolic programs required for infection will enable the development of effective therapeutic treatments in the future.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND HOW CAN SUCCESS BE MEASURED?\\n\\nCriticism of systems biology includes the following: \"it's too slow; it's too expensive; it's a fishing expedition.\" We readily admit that systems approaches are currently driven more by technology and computing than by a clear understanding of the data. Indeed, a major challenge is to thoroughly mine the existing data before accumulating even more information. However, critics must be cognizant of the immense challenges involved with this approach. For example, we need to create a new interdisciplinary culture along with a new vocabulary. We need to break down the traditional silos of information present in most scientific research endeavors. We need to merge the experimental with the clinical with FIG 2 Iterative cycles of perturbation biology. The infectious disease questions, the first step in the cycle, determine the appropriate biological models and technologies utilized to generate multidimensional data. Data analysis and integration identify key components, pathways, and networks which allow for the construction of a predictive model. Model-predicted biological bottlenecks or key network nodes are validated by performing additional targeted experiments and data integration, resulting in a refined model. Importantly, several rounds of biological perturbations (i.e., use of mutant pathogens, cellular small interfering RNA [siRNA] knockdowns or knockout mice) are required to produce a predictive model that could be effectively utilized by the general infectious disease community. In addition to a more comprehensive understanding of the host-pathogen response and testable models, this type of perturbation biology will produce publicly disseminated multidimensional data sets and potentially both diagnostic signatures and drug targets. the computational and mathematical. We need to build bridges between diverse members of the scientific community who otherwise do not communicate with each other. The iterative cycle of experimental design, sample preparation, high-throughput assays, and data integration and analysis that is an absolute requirement for an effective systems approach is a lengthy, repetitious, and unglamorous process. But without this iterative progression, predictive and revealing models are not achievable.We acknowledge that the best response to this criticism is to provide fundamental knowledge directly relevant to human health that could not otherwise be achieved through traditional scientific approaches: better cures and vaccines and better drugs and diagnostics. But just as systems biology differs in many aspects from more traditional basic research approaches, the methods for measuring success also differ. Although publications are one important measurement, an additional measure of success is the utilization of the generated resources by the scientific community, including experimental data sets, software tools, computational models, and research protocols, all made available to the scientific community through the four Centers' and NIAID websites (http: //www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/sb/Pages /default.aspx). We call upon researchers outside the Centers to utilize the vast data sets and other resources being generated to further the knowledge and understanding of pathogen-host interactions.As highlighted in a recent review, systems biology is already making important contributions to cancer research (7) . The approach has been used to identify network motifs that can accurately predict the development of distant metastases in breast cancer patients-tumors that may develop years after the primary tumor and which frequently prove fatal. A network-centric approach has also identified specific oncogenes in certain types of B-cell lymphomas, and a multiscale mathematical model has been developed to test the efficacy of different radiation protocols, which has led to improvements in radiation therapies for colorectal cancer. The cancer field was one of the first research communities to aggressively embrace (and fund) the use of systems biology. We believe that the infectious disease community will build on the resulting substantial systems biology methodologies and insights to claim similar successes in the near future. We invite your thoughts and comments on this perspective.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\n\\nThere is a disproportionate number of individuals with mental and somatic illnesses among persons in detention (Bhugra, 2020; Ginn, 2012) . It is also known that infections which are transmitted human to human via droplet or close contact spread particularly well in confined spaces. Since transfer options for further treatment are more difficult (especially in detention facilities) preventive measures are strongly emphasized, particularly in the case of viral droplet infections. For example, in the context of influenza, vaccination of detainees and staff is recommended (NHS 2019) . If such options are not available, prisons and other closed facilities, like asylum centers, shelters, and closed psychiatric hospitals, pose a risk for the rapid spread of such diseases. In the past, Australia for example has described the rapid spread of influenza among prison inmates (Awofeso et al., 2001) . The Spanish flu is also reported to have affected about a quarter of all inmates; a prevalence much higher when compared to data from the general population (Finnie, Copley, Hall, &amp; Leach, 2014) . We are also currently receiving news from China, which reports a rapid spread of Covid-19 infections among prisoners from the Hubei Province. Regarding Covid-19, the spread seems to have been caused by infected security personnel importing it into detention facilities. According to the media, the Chinese government reacted to the outbreak among inmates by locking down affected prisons, suspending the transportation of goods, testing inmates who were in contact with the diagnosed wardens, and also by dismissing the prison directors and setting up a commission to analyse the spread of the virus among detained individuals (Caixing Global 2019). Correctly, there has recently been talk of a \"blind spot\" in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19 among prison inmates. (Global Times 2020) We argue that the blind spot extends further to particularly marginalized groups such as individuals using and abusing drugs and people without legal residence status, especially since these groups often overlap with individuals in detention (Liem, Wang, Wariyanti, Latkin, &amp; Hall, 2020) . Under normal circumstances, the psychological and psychiatric care of individuals in prison is already a major challenge for many health care systems; a problem that is even more evident in times of crisis, as is currently observed. The difficulties arise on different levels and affect detained individuals, security personnel, as well as medical staff alike (Chen et al., 2020) . Fears, worries, and uncertainties, especially for isolated or quarantined patients, can cause an increase in stress-related illnesses but also the exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (Duan &amp; Zhu, 2020) . This leads to a dilemma: the higher level of care and support that is required is contravened by recommendations that, especially under conditions of isolation, advise against the routine consultation of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in order to prevent the spread of infections. In this situation, medical staff, who are primarily focused on treating the infection (or complications thereof), must then additionally provide psychological care and be ready to intervene during a mental health crisis. Against this backdrop, some authors advocate for the use of online counselling tools and web platforms to support individuals in isolation and those affected (Liu et al., 2020) . Although these recommendations are directed at the general population and not at a prison population, it does not seem reasonable that such channels of care should not be used for individuals under detention as well. Other models could be envisaged, such as the provision of telephone counselling for prisoners and staff. However, for the current outbreak of Covid-19, such elements may not be implemented quickly enough. This raises the question of how to provide rational, basic psychiatric care under the current challenging conditions. We urge that governments take into account special needs of people in confined closed spaces. They must try: -Preserving continuity in provision of psychiatric and psychological care to individuals in detention is imperative and should remain so during the Covid-19 outbreak. -Early coordination between regional prison authorities, prison psychiatry, and general medical and general psychiatric care providers (e.g. in cases of referrals). This must also include close liaison with court diversion schemes, probation officers and others. Some clear guidance needs to be developed urgently regarding visitors to prisons and jails. -Given the potential shortage of time and human resources, the more severe psychiatric and psychological cases must be carefully triaged.Here, factors such as pre-existing mental illness, self-and extraneous endangerment, violence and aggressive behavior, refusal to eat, and also assessments and recommendations of experienced security staff should be taken into account. -Given the flood of perceivable unsettling information on Covid-19, staff providing psychological or psychiatric treatment should be informed regularly and urgently about symptomatology and presentation and on the realistic clinical course, also in comparison to other infectious diseases or in comparison to other daily risks. Sharing of accurate information without bias and panic is critical. -Ensuring the provision of masks, disinfectants and protective measures in sufficient quantity for psychological and psychiatric staff visiting individuals in detention. -Particular attention should also be paid to certify that staff deployed to provide psychological-psychiatric care in institutions are informed and/or sensitized of known potential risk factors for a more severe course of a Covid-19 infection of their own (advanced age, somatic comorbidities, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cancer, known immune deficiencies etc.). Due to the currently limited understanding of Covid-19, it may be advisable to prohibit employees with such conditions from providing psychological or psychiatric care to individuals in detention and prisons. -If there is a sudden shortage of staff providing psychological and psychiatric care to detained individuals with a mental illness, staff from general psychiatry may have to fill consequential gaps. This needs careful planning on an urgent basis so that the potential of extremely long working hours of medical staff during the current outbreak can be managed successfully.From a contemporary perspective, with increasing numbers of reported cases from South Korea, Iran, and Italy and, in some cases, comparably drastic interventions (sealing off entire regions), as well as reports of a rapid spread of Covid-19 among individuals in prison or in other closed societies, the provision of general medical care to those affected has already become a challenge in some parts of the world,. 12 However, it should not be forgotten that psychiatric and psychological care must not just be provided to affected individuals among the general population, but also to vulnerable groups such as people in detention, homes, and asylum centers.

The first patient, an 87-year-old man became ill on February 19th and died on February 27th. The second patient, also male and 27 years old, became ill on February 27th and died on March 4th. In both cases there were fever, cough, and respiratory tract infection during the early stages of the illness. Five to ten days later, the patients developed severe pneumonia and progressive respiratory distress with lethal outcome.Following the guidelines of the nation-wide alert network for diagnosis of respiratory infectious diseases established in 2008, etiological studies were immediately carried out at the Laboratory of Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, which is one of the 16 sites selected for survey in the alert network. Blood, throat swabs and sputum samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction using primers for amplification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, new corona virus, and H5N1 influenza virus, which all yielded negative results. The only positive results were observed by using universal primers for amplification of influenza A viruses. To identify the viral subtype, the gene segments were subjected to further amplification, sequencing and blast analysis. The results showed that the hemagglutinin fragment showed high homology to influenza A virus H7 (94.8%) while the neuraminidase fragment was high homologue to influenza A virus N9 (94.2%). MP, NP, PA, PB1, PB2 showed 97%-99% homology with H9N2 virus. Specimens were sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation and H7N9 avian influenza viruses were isolated. China National Health and Family Planning Commission organized experts to do a comprehensive analysis based on the laboratory results, clinical manifestations of patients, epidemiological data, and concluded that the patients were infected with strains of H7N9 avian influenza virus. China National Health and Family Planning Commission notified the World Health Organization that a new H7N9 avian flu virus had caused lethal human infections in China (Gao RB et al., unpublished). Epidemiological survey revealed no H7N9 infection occurred among close contacts of the lethal cases. Both lethal cases had a history of contacts with pigs, but not with chickens. In contrast, some of the H7N9 cases observed subsequently in Jiangsu province had a history of slaughtering chickens. The municipal government of Shanghai has implemented stage III regulations for survey and control for fever and acute respiratory infections in all hospitals, and up to April 4th, fourteen cases with six deaths have been reported.Emerging viral diseases are a continuous threat to humans worldwide, and the majority of the emerging viruses originated from animal hosts. Of particular concern is the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans with or without pigs as intermediate hosts.Though such zoonotic transmissions are usually self-limited, they always pose a pandemic threat, since the viruses may adapt to humans. The avian influenza viruses that have occasionally infected and caused disease in people without showing human adaptation comprise H5N1, H9N2, and a variety of H7 viruses. 1,2 The H7 viruses isolated from humans include both highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian viruses. Whereas highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7 viruses may cause fatal disease in people, all human infections caused by low pathogenic H7 viruses so far had been mild. It is therefore concerning to see that the new H7N9 virus which, according to the available evidence, is derived from a low pathogenic avian virus can be lethal for man. However, it has to be emphasized that it is not clear yet whether the H7N9 virus is transmitted directly from birds or pigs to people. So far, this virus as an agent not causing disease in animals may escape detection in an animal reservoir more easily than the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. It is also not clear whether the current H7N9 human infection is a rare event, or the severe cases observed are just the tip of an iceberg of many asymptomatic human infections as has been suggested for H9N2 3 and H7N3 4 viruses.The identification of H7N9 virus as a cause of human disease is only the beginning of a long journey aimed at the elucidation of the epidemiology, the host range, and the pathogenicity of this virus, and at the development of efficient vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, adequate surveillance is the most important. The nation wide alert laboratory network established at 16 selected sites in China significantly contributed to the immediate identification of the emerging H7N9 virus, demonstrating that generous financial support from the government is necessary and fruitful. However, integrated surveillance of animal and human infections still needs to be improved. The barriers between physicians and veterinarians should be removed, and gaps should be filled between government agencies responsible for animal health (Ministry of Agriculture) and public health (Ministry of Health). While a close watch on H7N9 is going on in China, we expect that at the same time, basic research and international collaboration will be supported and encouraged.While writing this news, up to April 6th, the number of patients infected with H7N9 in mainland China has increased to 16, with six deaths, distributed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and all are in the eastern part of China. Only few patients had a history of contact with chickens. Among them, one is a four-year-old child with very mild respiratory infection symptoms but showed H9N7 positive by polymerase chain reaction in his throat swab. Currently in Shanghai and several other provinces, strict survey for H9N7 cases has been implemented in outpatients with fever and respiratory infections in all hospitals. At the same time survey for H9N7 among wild birds and poultries has been carried out by the animal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and confirmed by the National Key Laboratory of Avian Influenza Institute in Harbin. H7N9 isolates with high homology have been detected in pigeons from Songjiang district of Shanghai, and sanitary measures including slaughtering pigeons in that region and shutting down of markets trading live poultries in Shanghai have been implemented. Since this new virus is susceptible to antiviral drug oseltamivir, patients were treated with this drug as early as possible after the diagnosis.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Rapid diagnosis has been a challenge that may be amenable to molecular point-ofcare testing (POCT). Methods We performed a prospective observational study of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. There were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. The chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. Two nasal swabs were taken at the onset of symptoms. One swab was analysed within 45 min using a molecular POCT for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. After the Games, the other swab was tested for 16 possible causative respiratory viruses using PCR in laboratory-based testing. Results 20 out of 44 (45%) athletes and 22 out of 68 (32%) staff members experienced symptoms of the common cold during a median stay of 21 days. Eleven (26%) samples tested virus-positive using POCT. All subjects with influenza (n=6) and 32 close contacts were treated with oseltamivir. The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 75% of the athletes and 68 % of the staff members. Seven virus clusters were identified. They were caused by coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. The virus infections spread readily within the team, most commonly within the same sport discipline. Conclusions The cold was indeed a common illness in Team Finland during the Winter Olympic Games. POCT proved to be clinically valuable, especially for influenza. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in most cases.\\n\\n</td>\n",
              "      <td>InTROduCTIOn\\n\\nElite athletes are predisposed to the common cold due to heavy physical and mental stress which may suppress both innate and adaptive immunity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Air travel, human crowding, housing with other athletes and competition all increase the susceptibility of an elite athlete to the common cold. 6 The Winter Olympic Games take place during periods of low temperatures and its timing coincides with epidemics of many respiratory viruses. The common cold has been said to be 'the most dreaded opponent' at the Winter Olympic Games, and may ruin the athlete's long-term goal of success. 7 The common cold is a prevalent, complex and heterogeneous illness. 8 More than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist, and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies. 9 10 Signs and symptoms of different viral infections overlap, and it is not possible to identify the aetiological agent on clinical grounds alone. 11 12 Antiviral treatment is only available for influenza, but virus-specific preventive measures may reduce the transmission of illnesses. 13 14 The aim of our prospective observational study was to investigate the occurrence and aetiology of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. We used recently developed molecular multiplexed POCT for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus at the Games site. 15 16 After the Games, we used laboratory-based PCR testing to detect 16 possible causative respiratory viruses.\\n\\nStudy planning and participants\\n\\nThis prospective observational study was carried out during the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeong-Chang, South Korea between 26 January and 28 February 2018. During the Games, the temperature and humidity measured by Team Finland varied between −17°C and +8°C and between 12% and 77%, respectively. Monitoring of the common cold was provided to Team Finland members who stayed in the Olympic Village (45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members) and the two hotels outside the village (22 staff members) (figure 1). The mean age of the athletes (n=45) was 27 (SD 6) years and the mean age of the staff members (n=68) was 44 (SD 9). Thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female. The team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their Olympic trip, starting from their departure from Helsinki airport and finishing with their return to Helsinki airport, thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min. On their departure, all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion. The team members stayed in PyeongChang for a median length of 21 days (with a range of 10-32 days). They lived in groups of 5-6 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats. Figure 1 Flow chart of the study. More than one mucus sample was taken from 28 participants. Eleven POCT samples were not available for retesting in the laboratory. Due to lack of POCT reagents onsite, 12 samples were only tested in the laboratory. POCT, point-of-care testing. 1Total No. of tests performed including subjects tested more than once.\\n\\nOriginal article\\n\\nAll team members were instructed to immediately report symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection to the chief physician (MV), who stayed in the same building. At the onset of a symptom, two nasal mucus specimens (one from each nostril) were collected at a depth of 3-4 cm using flocked nasal swabs (503CS01, Copan Flock Technologies, Brescia, Italy). One specimen was used immediately for POCT and the other was refrigerated in a dry storage tube (553C, Copan Flock Technologies, Brescia, Italy) in the team's medical room. Swabs were also taken from subjects exposed to a patient with the common cold. Specimens for POCT were collected as part of the medical care of the team members.All study-related activities were conducted according to good clinical practice, which includes the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.Four athletes competed with mild symptoms of the common cold. One athlete competed 5 days after the onset of an influenza B infection, another competed 5 days after the onset of a respiratory syncytial virus A infection and two athletes competed five days after the onset of a metapneumovirus infection.\\n\\nAssessment of illness\\n\\nThe common cold was defined as the acute onset of any of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and cough. 8 In addition, fever (an axillary temperature ≥37.8°C), hoarseness and lethargy were recorded on a standardised form in the evening on a four-point severity scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe). 17 The total symptom score for the first 5 days of illness was calculated.\\n\\nMicrobiological studies\\n\\nA fast, automated POCT, the Cepheid Xpert Influenza+RSV Xpress Assay, was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 16 A nasal swab was suspended into 3 mL of universal transport medium (UTM, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) and 300 µL of suspension was added into the assay cartridge, which was then loaded into the Cepheid GeneXpert II instrument. After a processing time of 30 min, the test reading was recorded.For laboratory testing, stored specimens were suspended into 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. Nucleic acids were extracted from 500 µL aliquots of the suspended specimens with the MagNA Pure 96 System using a MagNA Pure 96 DNA Viral NA LV 2.0 kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the Pathogen Universal 500 3.1 protocol and an elution volume of 50 µL. The extracted nucleic acids were stored at −70°C between analyses. Allplex Respiratory Panels 1-4 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and the CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) instrument were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to detect respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, parainfluenza type 1-4 viruses, human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus using 8 µL of each specimen per panel. The AllPlex Respiratory Panel also detected the following bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A laboratory-designed triplex RT-PCR assay for influenza A, A/H1pdm09 and B viruses was performed as described earlier, with the exception that NxtScript DNA Master (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and Mic PCR instrument (Bio Molecular Systems, Upper Coomera, QLD, Queensland, Australia) were used for the PCR step. 18 In addition, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected using a triplex RT-PCR assay as described earlier, with the exception that Sensi-FAST Probe No-ROX kit (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany), and Mic PCR instrument were used for the PCR step. 19 A virus cluster was defined as three detections of the same virus during the median length of 3 weeks. This was considered an unusual aggregation event.\\n\\nStatistics\\n\\nThe difference between proportions was tested with a binomial standard normal deviation (SND) test and 95% CIs were calculated accordingly.\\n\\nOccurrence of the common cold\\n\\nForty-two out of 112 team members reported symptoms of respiratory infection during the study period of 10-32 days (median 21 days). There were 20 athletes (45%) and 22 (32%) staff members (p=0.123, 95% CI −5.2 to 31.2). Two athletes and two staff members suffered from a febrile illness. The mean duration of the symptoms was 8.3 (SD 7.8) days and 8.7 (SD 8.9) days in the athletes and the staff, respectively. One athlete and one staff member suffered from symptoms throughout their entire stay in the village (figure 2). Symptoms were mostly mild, and the mean total severity score was 6.4 (SD 5.9) for the athletes and 7.3 (SD 5.7) for the staff (table 1) . Only one athlete lost a competition on 1 day due to a respiratory infection.\\n\\nAetiology of the common cold detected by molecular POCT\\n\\nOnsite, the aetiology of respiratory infections was identified in 11 of 42 (26%) symptomatic cases. Before the Games, two cases of influenza B were detected by local healthcare services using antigen detection. POCT in the team's medical room detected one case of influenza A virus, three cases of influenza B virus and five cases of respiratory syncytial virus A. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in six athletes and in five staff members. All six patients with an influenza virus infection were treated with oseltamivir. Oseltamivir prophylaxis was given to their 32 contacts (11 athletes). None of them developed a symptomatic infection.\\n\\nAetiology of the common cold detected by multiplex-PCRtesting in the laboratory\\n\\nThe aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 30 figure 2 ). In five athletes and nine staff members (p=0.117), the PCR cycle threshold values were &lt;27, indicating high viral load (figure 2). In 8 out of 20 virus-positive cases, a previous or later nasal specimen was virus-negative. Nasal mucus samples were taken from 34 asymptomatic subjects due to close contact to a symptomatic subject. Eight samples were virus-positive (rhinovirus 3, coronavirus 229E 3, coronavirus NL63 2).Multiplexed PCR-testing for nasal bacteria identified H. influenzae in seven subjects and S. pneumoniae in two subjects. Co-detection with a respiratory virus was found in three out of nine cases. No cases of atypical bacteria were identified. Clinically no cases of probable bacterial infections were recorded. N  11  5  5  5  5  5  3  1  1   Asymptomatic   N  3  0  0  3  0  2 Eleven specimens were not available for retesting in the laboratory. All other POCT results were confirmed in the laboratory.\\n\\nTransmission of the common cold within the team\\n\\nOne subject reported nasal congestion when departing Finland. Respiratory syncytial virus A was detected at the Olympic Village. Six days later, the neighbouring team member in the aeroplane developed symptomatic respiratory syncytial virus A -infection. The next respiratory syncytial virus A cases were identified consequently 10, 16 and 17 days after the initial respiratory syncytial virus A detection.One subject developed a febrile influenza B infection during the 9-hour outbound flight. Another subject on the same flight (seated one row behind) developed an influenza B infection 1.5 days later. Three more subjects were infected with the influenza B virus. These cases were separate and were not known to be in contact with the earlier cases.One subject developed nasal congestion during the 9-hour flight, later detected to be a respiratory syncytial virus B infection. The subject was seated in business class and was isolated for 4 days in the Olympic Village. No other team member was infected with respiratory syncytial virus B.One subject reported a sore throat and mild lethargy 6 days after the departure. Metapneumovirus was detected. Metapneumovirus was detected in team members consequently 8, 13, 15 and 18 days after the initial metapneumovirus detection.Rhinovirus was detected in two samples from asymptomatic individuals 3 days and 4 days after their departure from Finland. One subject later arrived in the village with a symptomatic rhinovirus infection. One more subject developed nasal congestion in the village and one asymptomatic subject staying outside the village was predisposed to influenza B infection. In both cases, rhinovirus infection was later laboratory-confirmed. According to the incubation time and known contacts, the rhinovirus infections in the team were considered separate.Coronavirus 229E was detected in two subjects on February 13. The following cases were identified consequently 7, 8 (2 cases), 9 (4 cases) and 10 (2 cases) days after the initial detections. Three of these infections were asymptomatic. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in one subject 1 day after the subject departed Helsinki. Two further cases were identified 2 and 4 days after the initial case. Two asymptomatic coronavirus NL63 cases were identified on February 12. Two and one symptomatic subjects were detected 5 and 13 days later.Altogether seven virus clusters were identified. Four clusters (respiratory syncytial virus A, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and NL63) occurred within the same sport discipline (table 2) . Inter-disciplinary transmission was rare (data not shown).\\n\\ndISCuSSIOn\\n\\nWe discuss three main findings from this prospective observational study. First, 45% of the elite athletes and 32% of the staff members suffered from the symptoms of the common cold during the median stay of 3 weeks at the Winter Olympic Games. Second, POCT multiplex PCR diagnostics rapidly detected influenza A and B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections. Third, the probable aetiology of the common cold could be detected in 75% of the athletes and 68% of the staff members. Coronaviruses were the most common causative agents. Unexpectedly, clusters of seven respiratory viruses were found within the team.\\n\\nOccurrence of the common cold during the winter games\\n\\nTwo previous studies by the IOC reported 2% and 4% incidences of respiratory infections in elite athletes during the Vancouver 2010 and the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, respectively. 20 21 Our observation (45%) contrasts those observations. The IOC's reporting system may not be reliable because it is based on voluntary reporting by team physicians, who may not be properly informed within the team. At the onset of the Games, in our study, the team physician informed all team members about the monitoring of the common cold. She stayed in the same building as the team which allowed for daily encounters with the majority of team members. Even one symptom or mild symptoms were reported. 22 In agreement with our observations, 48% of 44 Norwegian cross-country skiers self-reported becoming ill during or 10 days immediately after the Tour de Ski. 23\\n\\nAetiology of the common cold in elite athletes\\n\\nOur study is the first to detect the aetiology of respiratory infections in elite athletes using molecular POCT at a major event. All available POCT virus diagnoses (positive and negative) were later confirmed at a laboratory. Diagnostics had clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections. In addition to early treatment with oseltamivir, POCT enabled effective post-contact oseltamivir prophylaxis for close contacts, for example, those living in the same accommodation or travelling on the same flight or in the same vehicle. 14 The isolation of infected team members was initiated after the onset of symptoms and continued for 3-4 days (ie, the most infectious period). [24] [25] [26] [27] We detected the probable causative virus in 75% of the elite athletes with the common cold. Causality is supported by a 4%-6% occurrence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults. 28 29 Only two earlier studies carried out in Australia in warm climate conditions have investigated the viral aetiology of acute respiratory symptoms in summer sport elite athletes. In one study the recovery rate was 29% and in the other it was 27%. 30 31 These low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation. Our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion. The virus recovery rate of 75% in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults. 9 10 A higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because PCR tests may detect only 50%-90% of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections. 13 32 The occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members. The difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes. It is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff (table 1) . Before and during the Winter Games, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in Finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in South Korea. The prevailing virus epidemics obviously contributed to the transmission of the infections.\\n\\nTransmission of the common cold\\n\\nIn three subjects, the symptoms of the common cold-one caused by influenza B virus and the others by respiratory syncytial virus A and B-developed during the 9-hour flight from Helsinki to Seoul. Two patients seemed to transmit the illness to another team member during the flight. Long-haul air travel is a wellknown risk factor for the transmission of contagious diseases. One person with influenza can transmit the infection to 5-10 people during an intercontinental flight. 33 Two cases of coronavirus OC43 infection were most probably travelling during the incubation period of the infection (3.5 days) and developed the illness within 2-3 days after arrival in the Olympic Village. 27 34 In addition, the first cases of rhinovirus and metapneumovirus infections were detected during the first week, suggesting that these infections also originated in Finland. 34 In addition to direct or indirect contact and droplets, respiratory viruses can spread via exhaled aerosols, even while talking. 35 36 Viruses may stay infectious on a surface for hours or days. The most commonly detected coronavirus 229E, stays infectious on common surfaces for at least 7 days. 37 Interestingly, it was recently shown that viruses can also spread through toilet flushing. 38 All subjects with influenza and close contact with individuals with influenza were treated with oseltamivir. ► In the laboratory the aetiology of the common cold was detected in 75% of the elite athletes. These athletes did not suffer from 'non-infectious airway inflammation in athletes'. ► Nine different respiratory viruses were detected, causing seven clusters of respiratory infections within the team. Coronaviruses were the most common viruses. Most viruses probably originated in Finland.\\n\\nhow might it impact on clinical practice in the future?\\n\\n► POCT diagnostics for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses should be made available at major sport events. POCT will improve the proper treatment, for example, targeted treatment of influenza, decrease unnecessary antibiotic treatment and enhance timely isolation to decrease viral transmission. ► The incidence of influenza virus infection reinforces the need for influenza vaccination in sport teams. ► At major sport events, healthcare providers should share information concerning detected respiratory virus infections to all teams to prevent an epidemics of respiratory viruses.housing with other athletes and the sport discipline (table 1) . Competition venues may be a favourable environment for virus transmission. Rigorous hand washing, the use of hand sanitisers, enhanced disinfection and strict patient isolation were likely to prevent the spread of viruses within the team but were apparently not very effective ( figure 2 ). This is due to the multifactorial transmission mechanisms of viral infections. 39\\n\\nStudy limitations\\n\\nThe number of subjects was small. Nasal swabs were planned to be taken from symptomatic subjects as part of normal healthcare. The prevalence and clinical significance of asymptomatic infections (eg, most coronavirus and influenza infections are asymptomatic) and prolonged virus shedding (ie, infectiousness) remains unclear. The POCT diagnostics detected only three respiratory viruses. 16 The 2018 influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were prominent, which may have increased our detection rate and affected the generalisability of the findings. Our study did not answer the question concerning the impact of a symptomatic or asymptomatic respiratory virus infection on an elite athlete's performance.\\n\\nCOnCluSIOnS\\n\\nMolecular POCT diagnostics proved clinically valuable. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in the majority of cases. The viruses were readily transmitted within the team. We believe comprehensive viral POCT is useful at major sporting events.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>Abstract\\n\\nSmall RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21-to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3=-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.Citation Girardi E, Chane-Woon-Ming B, Messmer M, Kaukinen P, Pfeffer S. 2013.

              "      <td>IMPORTANCE In a continuous arms race, viruses have to deal with host antiviral responses in order to successfully establish an infection. In mammalian cells, the host defense mechanism relies on the recognition of viral RNAs, resulting in the activation of type I interferons (IFNs). In turn, the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is induced to inhibit viral replication. Here we report that the cytoplasmic, interferon-induced, cellular endoribonuclease RNase L is involved in the accumulation of a novel small RNA population of viral origin. These small RNAs are produced upon SINV infection of mammalian cells and are stabilized by a 3=-end modification. Altogether, our findings indicate that in our system RNA silencing is not active against Sindbis virus (SINV) and might open the way to a better understanding of the antiviral response mediated by a novel class of small RNAs.\\n\\ncontinuous arms race with their hosts, the outcome of which might ultimately result in either viral persistence, clearance of the viral infection, or death of the infected cells. The arsenal of antiviral defenses and viral counter defense mechanisms is vast and very diverse among the different phyla of life. Plants, insects, nematodes, and fungi mostly (if not exclusively) rely upon an innate immune response, whereas mammals have evolved an adaptive response in addition to this first line of defense. In the former organisms, the antiviral component of the innate immune response is mainly based on a highly conserved process commonly referred to as RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi). In this phenomenon, long double-stranded RNAs of viral origin are cleaved by the RNase Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then assembled into effector complexes that contain a member of the Argonaute (Ago) family; this results in targeted degradation of viral messenger or genomic RNAs (1) .In mammals, another type of innate immunity has evolved to control viruses (2) . The initial recognition of nonself viral nucleic acids by extra-and intracellular sensors triggers the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) (3) . This leads in turn to the upregulation of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (4) , which either directly trigger a signaling cascade directed against the viral infection or mobilize other cells of the immune system. ISGs encode proteins involved in apoptosis induction, protein synthesis blocking, or in the regulation of mRNA editing or RNA degradation (5) .One key factor involved in IFN type I-mediated host defense is RNase L, a latent cytoplasmic endoribonuclease that is activated by 2=,5=-oligoadenylates in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and that cleaves both viral and cellular RNAs (6) .Although extensive deep sequencing analyses have been performed to identify siRNAs in mammalian cells infected with several RNA viruses, there is so far no good evidence for a possible antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian somatic cells (7) . Nevertheless, another class of small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), has been shown to play an important role during viral infection in mammals. miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small RNAs derived from large primary transcripts, which are sequentially processed by the respective nuclear and cytoplasmic RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, to generate mature single-stranded~21-or 22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs (8, 9) . Similar to siRNAs, they are incorporated into an effector Ago-containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby they mediate posttranscriptional regulation of target mRNAs via partially complementary sites (10) . On one hand, miRNAs of cellular origin can directly or indirectly regulate viral infections (11, 12) . On the other hand, some viruses have evolved the capacity to encode their own miRNAs, which represent an ideal tool to stealthily modulate the cellular environment. To date, viral miRNAs have been almost exclusively identified in the genomes of DNA viruses, mostly herpesviruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , with the notable exception of bovine leukemia virus, a retrovirus with an RNA genome (18) . It has been commonly assumed that cytoplasmic RNA viruses cannot encode miRNAs, not only because they do not have access to the nuclear biogenesis machinery but also because their genomic integrity would be destabilized by miRNA processing (19) . Nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that the insertion of a cellular miRNA precursor into the 3=-end nontranslated region (NTR) of Sindbis virus (SINV) genomic RNA leads to its cytoplasmic processing without affecting the viral replication (20, 21) .The arthropod-borne SINV is a small, enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus and is the prototype for the alphavirus genus. Alphaviruses represent a group of widely distributed human and animal pathogens, which pose a serious public health threat (22) . Some of them induce febrile and arthritogenic diseases, while others can cause highly debilitating diseases, such as encephalitis. The SINV genomic RNA is capped and polyadenylated and is infectious as naked RNA. Upon entry into the cytoplasm by endocytosis, the host translational machinery recognizes the genomic RNA, and four nonstructural proteins are produced (23) . Their expression is sufficient for the establishment of replication complexes and the synthesis of a complementary antigenomic negative RNA strand. The antigenome is necessary for the replication of the viral genome and the production of a subgenomic RNA that ensures the translation of the structural proteins during the late phase of infection (24, 25) .To date, SINV has not been shown to give rise to any small RNA species in mammalian cells. As such, we decided to investigate the small RNA profile of SINV-infected human and African green monkey cell lines. Using small RNA cloning and deep sequencing techniques, we provide evidence that the SINV genome is a source of small RNAs in infected mammalian cells. Some of these small RNAs accumulate to levels detected by Northern blot analysis. We set out to identify the factors involved in their biogenesis and show that they do not depend on the RNA silencing machinery, but rather, that they are downstream products of the cytoplasmic IFN-induced endoribonuclease RNase L. Finally, we also present experimental evidence that these viral small RNAs are modified at their 3= extremity. Altogether, our results indicate that the SINV-derived small RNAs could represent key markers of the host defense mechanism.\\n\\nSINV-derived small RNAs accumulate in infected mammalian cells.\\n\\nIn order to investigate the presence and nature of virusderived small RNAs in mammalian cells, we used a small RNA cloning and deep sequencing approach. We generated and analyzed small RNA libraries from both HEK293 and Vero cells infected with SINV or not infected with SINV.Total RNA was isolated from uninfected cells or cells infected with SINV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 plaque forming units (PFU) per cell 16 h postinfection (hpi). Using these conditions, we could detect cells with a high viral load without observing any apparent cell death as assessed by propidium iodide staining (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We also confirmed that until 24 hpi, cells were still actively proliferating (data not shown). High-throughput sequencing yielded 201,793 and 1,193,893 reads that mapped to the SINV genome in infected HEK293 and Vero cells, respectively (Fig. 1A) ; these two numbers of reads represented a percentage of 1.66 and 7.99%, respectively, of total mapped small RNAs in HEK293 and Vero cells. The greater fraction of viral reads in Vero cells is consistent with the fact that these cells are known to be more permissive to viral infections due to a defect in interferon production (26) . The distribution of the reads on the viral genomic (positive) and antigenomic (negative) strands is indicated in Fig. 1A . Interestingly, the vast majority of the reads (98 to 99%) originate from the genomic strand of the virus. Nonetheless, we identified limited sequencing reads that were derived from the negative strand, albeit at extremely low levels in both libraries (Fig. 1A) . Their genomic distribution showed a peak at the 3= end of the antigenome (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). This specific region corresponds to the viral promoter, necessary for the replication of the viral genome and is known to fold into a conserved 44-nt stemloop structure (25) . The length distribution of the antigenomic small RNA reads peaked at a size of 22 nt (Fig. S2B) , which corresponds to the 5= arm of the stem-loop structure (Fig. S2C ). Although we could validate the presence of the 44-nt-long RNA by Northern blot analysis, we were unable to detect the accumulation of the small 22-nt RNA as a discrete species (Fig. S2D) .The size distribution of the main population of viral reads mapping on the positive strand of the virus was broad with no defined peak at a specific length (Fig. 1B) . However, a closer inspection revealed that the overall size and genomic distribution of the viral reads were highly similar in both HEK293 and Vero cells (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, a greater number of reads were found between nucleotides 7000 and 11700 of the viral genome, corresponding to the abundantly expressed subgenomic RNA.We selected 14 candidates among the most abundant peaks obtained in both cell types for validation by Northern blot analysis (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). We could detect several SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) of 20 to 30 nt in length that were derived from all along the viral genome (Fig. S3B ). Among them, SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 were detected in both HEK293 and Vero cells (Fig. S3C) . The presence of abundant larger bands accumulating between 40 and 100 nt was also evidenced. Of note, the expression of both larger and smaller viral RNAs increased proportionally to the accumulation of the viral genome during a time course of infection ( Fig. 1D and E) . The identification of SINV-derived small RNAs prompted us to analyze more closely their origin and biochemical properties.The production of SvsRNAs does not rely on the miRNA biogenesis machinery. The identification of small RNAs from RNA viruses could be seen either as a result of a productive mechanism for the pathogen (as for virus-encoded miRNAs) or as the consequence of a host response to control the infection by degrading viral RNAs. SINV expresses four enzymes that play key functions during the viral replicative cycle. However, none of these enzymes is known to possess an endoribonuclease activity (22) that could enable the processing of small RNAs from a viral RNA precursor. Therefore, cellular enzymes have to be involved in the biogenesis of SINV sRNAs. In order to identify them, we decided to knock down cytoplasmic enzymes with a known RNase activity. We first focused on proteins important for the production of small RNAs, such as miRNAs. Hence, we transfected siRNAs against Drosha, Dicer, or Ago2 followed by an infection with SINV and an analysis of viral small RNA accumulation. Although Drosha is known to be mostly nuclear, we also took it into consideration because it was recently shown to relocalize to the cytoplasm upon SINV infection (21) . Although we were able to downregulate very efficiently Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2 (see Fig. S4A to C in the supplemental material), the knockdown of these factors neither affected the viral load nor the accumulation of SvsRNA-1, -2 and -3 ( Fig. S4D to G). We also examined whether we could detect an siRNA signature among all viral reads by looking for small RNAs that could perfectly base pair on 19 or 20 nt and present a 2-nt overhang in 3=. A very limited number of such duplexes could be found, but they were not more represented than larger duplexes presenting with 3= or 5= overhangs (data not shown). It has been reported that small RNAs, which are not generated by Dicer or Drosha cleavage, could nevertheless be assembled into Argonaute proteins (e.g., tRNA fragments [27] ). We therefore immunoprecipitated Argonaute proteins followed by Northern blot analysis to see whether SvsRNAs could be detected within the RISC. However, although we could detect the accumulation of the cellular miRNA miR-16, using both an antibody specific for Ago2 (Fig. S4H , left panel) and an antibody able to recognize all four Ago proteins (Fig. S4H , right panel), we were unable to detect SvsRNAs within immunoprecipitated RISC.RNase L is involved in the production of SvsRNAs. We then hypothesized that an endoribonuclease involved in the antiviral response could be implicated in SvsRNA production. RNase L is a ubiquitous, cytoplasmic, interferon-induced endonuclease that plays a key role in the cellular response to viral infections. It cleaves single-stranded RNA regions after the dinucleotides UA/UU, thereby preventing virus accumulation (28) . As such, we knocked down RNase L using siRNAs, before infecting the cells with SINV. As expected, RNase L knockdown (KD) resulted in the upregulation of the SINV genome by approximately 2.5-fold ( Fig. 2A and  B) . Interestingly, it also resulted in a dramatic reduction of the viral small RNAs SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 and their precursors (Fig. 2C) .In order to extend this observation and assess the role of RNase L in SvsRNA generation, we also produced small RNA libraries from HEK293 cells treated with a control or an RNase L-specific siRNA prior to SINV infection. In accordance with the striking effect seen on the three specific SvsRNAs, reduction in RNase L protein level decreased the entire population of clonable viral sequences from 2.75 to 1.19% (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). However, RNase L knockdown affected neither the size distribution of viral reads nor their genomic distribution ( Fig. S5B and C).Given the cleavage properties of RNase L (see next section), it was unlikely that the identified small RNAs were direct products of this enzyme. We therefore looked for other factors implicated in RNA degradation that could affect SvsRNA accumulation. We used RNAi to downregulate the expression of the major cytoplasmic 5=-3= exoribonuclease Xrn1 (Fig. 2D ). As expected, the capped viral genome was not affected by downregulation of Xrn1 (Fig. 2E) . However, the levels of SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 and their precursors were stabilized (Fig. 2F) . We then looked at the effect of combining knockdown of these factors (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). We found that the double knockdown of both RNase L and Dicer did not affect the accumulation of SvsRNA-1 compared to the single RNase L knockdown, which confirms that Dicer does not play a role (Fig. S6A) . On the contrary, the accumulation of SvsRNA-1 upon double knockdown of both RNase L and Xrn1 increased compared to the single RNase L knockdown (Fig. S6A ). This finding suggests that both RNase L and Xrn1 can act upon viral RNAs and have opposite activities in terms of generation and stabilization of the SvsRNAs. Xrn1 might act upstream of RNase L in degrading, for example, uncapped viral RNAs that would otherwise be a substrate for RNase L; alternatively, it could directly act upon the RNase L products. The former hypothesis is more likely though because Xrn1 has a preference for 5= phosphorylated RNAs, whereas RNase L leaves a 5= OH after cleavage. We also performed a high-molecular-weight Northern blot analysis to look at the effects of the various knockdowns on the accumulation of the genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs.The results confirm the quantitative PCR data, in that only the RNase L KD has an impact on the accumulation of both genomic and subgenomic RNAs (Fig. S6B) .We also tested several cytoplasmic 3=-5= exoribonucleases, including DIS3L, DIS3L2, and Rrp40 (also known as EXOSC3, a core subunit of the exosome); knockdown of these factors had no effect on SvsRNA accumulation (data not shown). This indicated that at least the main cytoplasmic 3=-5= exoribonucleases do not seem to be implicated in the production of the viral small RNAs.The 3= extremity of SvsRNA-1 is modified. RNase L processing produces a typical signature: the enzyme leaves a 5= hydroxyl (OH) and a 3= phosphate (P) after cleavage (6) . However, these features are not compatible with our small RNA cloning protocol (29) , which strictly relies on the presence of a 5= P and a 3= OH on the small RNA extremities. This prompted us to characterize the extremities of SvsRNAs to better understand their biogenesis. We initially decided to restrict our analysis to SvsRNA-1 because it accumulated as a major form of 23 nt. The assay used for the analysis of RNA 5= ends involved digestion with the Terminator exonuclease, a processive 5=-3= exonuclease that specifically targets and degrades RNAs with a 5= monophosphate, but not RNAs with 5= triphosphates, 5= OH, or a 5= CAP (30) .For a control, the Terminator reaction was carried out on both a 5= OH and a 5= P oligoribonucleotide with the same sequence as SvsRNA-1. Terminator treatment did not result in the degradation of the 5= OH synthetic oligoribonucleotide, whereas the 5= P RNA oligonucleotide was almost completely degraded. Accordingly, SvsRNA-1 is prone to degradation by the Terminator exonuclease, which is consistent with the presence of a monophosphate at the 5= end, while the accumulation of the precursor bands was less affected by the treatment (Fig. 3A) .Next, we performed sodium periodate (NaIO 4 ) treatment followed by ␤-elimination to specifically examine the 3= end of SvsRNA-1. The presence of hydroxyl groups in positions 2= and (B and E) SINV genomic RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR, before and after RNase L or Xrn1 KD. The relative quantification is normalized to GAPDH levels and is represented on a logarithmic scale as a mean of three replicates. (C and F) Northern blot analysis on total RNA from infected HEK293 cells before and after RNase L or Xrn1 KD. U6 was used as a normalizer.3= on the last ribose is needed for the periodate reaction. ␤-elimination of the oxidized RNA results in an RNA product one or two nucleotides shorter. On the contrary, the presence of modifications on the ribose of the 3= terminal residue renders the RNA insensitive to periodate oxidation and impairs the chain scission (31) . For a control for the reaction, we measured its effect on the unmodified cellular miRNA miR-16. As expected, the electrophoretic mobility of the miRNA strongly changed after treatment (Fig. 3B) . In contrast, SvsRNA-1 mobility was found to be insensitive to periodate oxidation and ␤-elimination (Fig. 3B) . This indicated the presence of a modification on the terminal ribose, most likely in the 2= position, which is perfectly compatible with our cloning protocol. Interestingly, it also seems that the intermediate RNA products are insensitive to periodate oxidation and are consequently modified (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). Moreover, we were also able to assess the existence of a modified 3= end for other SvsRNAs by Northern blotting (Fig. S8) .In order to gain more insight into the nature of this modification, we treated our samples with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 , and 16) prior to ␤-elimination (Fig. 3C, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16) . The double treatment strongly affected the mobility of a control oligoribonucleotide with a 3= P (Fig. 3C, lane 4) , while the mobility of the 3= OH oligonucleotide was affected independently of the CIP treatment (Fig. 3C, lanes 7  and 8) . Of note, the combined reactions changed neither the mobility of a control oligoribonucleotide bearing a CIP-insensitive modification (methyl group in position 2= of the last ribose) (Fig. 3C, lane 12) nor the mobility of SvsRNA-1 (Fig. 3C, lane 16) .Taken together, these results show that SvsRNA-1 is modified at its 3= extremity but that the modification is not due to a monophosphate group caused by a direct RNase L cut.Viral genomic RNA is modified on A 8333 . The presence of posttranscriptional modifications, such as 2=-O-methylation, is a characteristic of several cellular RNAs in mammals, such as rRNAs (32) , snRNAs (33) , and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) (34, 35) .Recently, it has also been reported for several viruses that their genomic RNA can be 2=-O-methylated at specific positions (36, 37) . We hypothesized that the modification on the small RNA could be derived from a modification at the level of the genomic RNA, which is reasonable given the fact that SvsRNA-1 precursor RNAs also appear to be modified (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). We thus looked for modifications in the genomic region spanning SvsRNA-1 using the RTL-P (reverse transcription at low deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations followed by polymerase chain reaction) technique (38) : the tendency of the reverse transcriptase to pause immediately before a 2=-Omethylated nucleotide is exploited to establish the efficiency of retrotranscription by semiquantitative PCR, using differential deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentrations.As shown in Fig. 4A , we designed a reverse transcription primer specific for the viral genome, as well as primers for semiquantitative PCR in the region surrounding SvsRNA-1 (shown in red): one reverse primer (R) and three forward primers, upstream (F U ) or downstream of the putative modification (F D1 and F D2 ). After retrotranscription with low and high dNTP concentrations, we performed multiplex PCR using primers F U /F D1 (in the SvsRNA-1 region) or primers F D1 /F D2 (in the control region) and then compared the signal intensity ratios of PCR products amplified with different numbers of PCR cycles (Fig. 4B ). Our data indicated that only the F U /F D1 ratio changed depending on the RT conditions (Fig. 4B, top panel) , suggesting that at a low dNTP concentration, the reverse transcriptase paused in the SvsRNA-1 region, most probably due to the presence of a modification on the viral genome in the region of interest.To further strengthen this observation and to identify the precise position of the nucleotide modification, we performed primer extension assays on RNA isolated from either SINV-infected HEK293 or Vero cells (Fig. 4C ). 2=-O-methylation can cause reverse transcriptase to pause one nucleotide before and/or at the O-methylated nucleotide. Indeed, we identified two bands (RT stops) that correspond to nucleotides G 8334 and A 8333 , the latter corresponding precisely to the 3= end of the SvsRNA-1 sequence (Fig. 4C) .These data imply that the 3=-end modification of SvsRNA-1 was likely already present on the viral genome and might be a 2=-O-methylation.3=-end modification is a hallmark of SvsRNAs. Taken together, our observations indicate that the SINV genomic RNA is modified, and are therefore suggestive of a potential modification of SvsRNAs. We then decided to investigate to what extent reads mapping to the SINV genome were modified at the last nucleotide position. Small RNA libraries were prepared from noninfected or SINV-infected HEK293 cells using total RNA treated (or not) with NaIO 4 . This treatment specifically impairs the 3= adapter ligation to RNA species with unmodified 3= ends (2= and 3= OH), while RNAs bearing a modification at one of these positions are resistant to oxidation, and can therefore be ligated. Overnight ligation of the 3= adapter at 16°C was performed in order to enhance the cloning of 2=-O modified small RNAs (39) .After deep sequencing of these libraries, we mapped the total number of reads against both the human and SINV genome (Table 1). As expected, in both noninfected and infected cells, the NaIO 4 treatment drastically reduced the number of clonable miRNA sequences (see also Fig. S9A in the supplemental material). In contrast, modified small RNAs (such as tRNA fragments) were preferentially cloned over miRNAs upon NaIO 4 treatment (Fig. S9B) . Strikingly, almost 75% of the viral reads were kept after oxidation ( Table 1 ). The oxidation treatment did not dramatically change the genomic distribution of the viral reads compared to the nontreated sample (Fig. 5A) . However, deep sequencing revealed some new peaks (Fig. 5A, arrows) that we could also validate by ␤-elimination and Northern blot analysis (see SvsRNA-15 and -16 in Fig. S8) .The size distribution of the viral reads remained unchanged before and after NaIO 4 treatment, indicating that SINV-derived modified RNAs belonged to each length (Fig. 5B) . Finally, we analyzed the nucleotide composition of the 3= end of SINV small RNAs and observed that we had enrichment in adenosine (A) at the 3= end after oxidation, which was not clearly discernible in the nontreated sample (Fig. 5C ). This is in line with the specific 2=-Omethylation occurring on internal adenosines recently identified on the genome of dengue virus (36) .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nMammals have evolved a very sophisticated innate immune response to ward off pathogens that is based on the sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by dedicated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). When it comes to viral infection, one of the most potent PAMPs is dsRNA. The recognition of dsRNA by PRRs triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the activation of interferon-sensitive genes (ISGs) (40) . RNA silencing is another type of antiviral innate immunity, which, as of now, has mostly been demonstrated in plant and insect organisms (1). Nonetheless, a role for RNA silencing as a host defense system against mammalian viruses could reasonably be considered. Indeed, Dicer, the key enzyme for dsRNA cleavage is conserved in higher vertebrates, and although its main substrate in vivo is pre-miRNA molecules, it is able to process long dsRNA into short RNAs in vitro (41) . However, the question as to which other types of dsRNA molecules mammalian Dicer can cleave in vivo has been the matter of intense research, and especially so when considering RNAs of viral origin. Here, we wanted to make our contribution to the field by studying the prototypical arbovirus, Sindbis virus. This type of virus can infect both insects and mammals, and as such is a useful tool to study the conservation of antiviral mechanisms in both phyla. Intriguingly, it has been shown for some members of the alphavirus genus that their genomic RNA can be processed into both siRNAs and piRNAs in insect somatic cells (42, 43) .In this study, we generated small RNA libraries from two different mammalian cell lines infected with SINV. Although the percentage of sequences mapping to the viral genome was significant (~1.7 to~8% in HEK293 and Vero cells, respectively), we were unable to detect either siRNA or piRNA signatures. On the contrary, the viral reads displayed a highly biased strand distribution. Although antigenomic (negative) strand-derived sequences represented a very small percentage of the total viral reads, they showed properties distinct from the genomic (positive) strand reads: their size distribution peaked at 22 nt, and their localization on the viral genome is restricted to the promoters required for the synthesis of both the genomic and subgenomic RNA. Although the cloned 22-nt sequences were not visible by Northern blot analysis, we could detect the accumulation of an~44-nt product that in our knowledge has never been observed before. We hypothesize that these RNA species could be critical for viral replication, similarly to what has been previously reported for influenza virus (44) .Consistent with the relative abundance of the positive strand compared to the negative strand, the majority of reads were derived from the plus-strand RNA and more specifically from the region corresponding to the subgenomic RNA sequence. We could detect several hot spots of small RNA accumulation, indicating that discrete SINV-derived viral small RNA species (SvsR-NAs) could be produced in infected mammalian cells. These Svs-RNAs do not display any peak in size distribution and do not map to any alphavirus conserved regions. Nonetheless, we noticed that they originate from the same viral genomic positions in both infected African green monkey and human cells. In order to confirm that this was not solely due to a bias in the small RNA cloning protocol, we performed Northern blot analyses of several small RNA candidates. For some of the candidates, we were able to detect discrete bands, which increased in intensity throughout the time course of infection.We therefore focused on the characterization of the positivestrand-derived small RNAs. One hypothesis regarding their identity could be that some of these SvsRNAs are in fact virus-encoded miRNAs. Using bioinformatics tools such as miRDeep2 (45, 46) and miRanalyzer2 (47, 48) , we excluded the possibility that putative miRNA precursor structures were present in the viral genome. Nonetheless, we tested whether the miRNA machinery was required for the production of viral small RNAs by knocking down Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2. The downregulation of these factors affected neither SINV replication nor accumulation of the three most abundant identified SvsRNAs, indicating that their production must involve another RNase. We discovered that the RNase L endonuclease is implicated in SvsRNA genesis. Indeed, its downregulation causes a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of Sindbis viral small RNAs detected by Northern blot analysis; this is accompanied by an upregulation of the viral genomic RNA. In order to extend this observation, we also generated small RNA libraries from HEK293 cells treated with siRNAs against RNase L and infected with SINV. We found that, under these conditions, the global population of SINV sRNAs was downregulated. RNase L is an endoribonuclease that is present in the cell in the form of an inactive monomer. Upon type I interferon induction, and more specifically 2=-5= oligoadenylate synthetase activation (6) , it can dimerize and then act upon its viral RNA targets. RNase L is known to play an antiviral role against viruses such as West Nile virus (49), hepatitis C virus (50) , and SINV (51) . We also looked at the involvement of exoribonucleases in the production of SvsRNAs and found that, indeed, the accumulation of these small RNAs is counteracted by the cellular 5=-3= exonuclease Xrn1. This suggests that SvsRNAs represent stable viral products of cellular decay enzymes. We therefore hypothesize that RNase L is the enzyme primarily involved in the generation of small RNAs and that the further processing operated by other uncharacterized enzymes could give rise to the final 20-to 30-nt-long viral RNAs. It also remains possible that some of the fragments we detected are direct products of RNase L but are further modified by kinases and dephosphorylases, which would allow their cloning.The fact that RNA fragments generated by RNase L are detected implies that some of them must be stabilized. Indeed, we discovered that the viral small RNA candidates appear to be modified on the 3= proximal nucleotide. We could extend this peculiarity to the global small RNA population by cloning and sequencing small RNAs after an oxidation treatment designed to prevent ligation of nonmodified RNAs. Our data indicate that this modification is most likely a 2=-O-methylation and seems to occur at the level of the viral genomic RNA, preferentially on adenosines. Thanks to a double approach of RTL-P and primer extension, we were able to map such a modification on position A 8333 of the SINV viral genome. Moreover, our sequencing data indicate that there are most likely many others given the enrichment in A residues at the 3= end of small RNAs cloned after oxidative treatment.The main protective mechanism against 3=-5= degradation is a 2=-O-methylation on the 3= proximal ribose, which prevents degradation by exoribonucleases and thus helps to stabilize small RNAs such as miRNAs and siRNAs in plants, piRNAs in animals, and siRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster (52) . This suggests that RNA modification could have evolved as a response to protect the anti-pathogen small RNAs during infections. Posttranscriptional RNA modifications represent an important but not yet fully understood system to regulate transcripts. Cellular RNAs contain many distinct posttranscriptional modifications at thousands of sites. In the same way, RNA viruses take advantage of nucleoside modifications on the base or on the ribose of their genomic RNA (36, 53) as a host mimicry strategy to abrogate innate immune signaling (54) .The enzyme responsible for the methylation of SINV RNA remains unknown. However, it has been reported that the alphavirus nsP2 protein contains a putative methyltransferase (MT)-like domain, similar to dengue virus NS5 MTase (55) . Although the activity of this domain has not been verified yet, nsP2-MTase mutant viruses exhibit a strong phenotype: negative-strand synthesis is continuous, and unstable viral replication complexes are produced. Surprisingly, RNase L-deficient cells infected with SINV display the same phenotype, suggesting that the two proteins function in similar events (55) . For all these reasons, we propose that RNase L-dependent, 3=-modified small RNAs from SINV could be involved as intermediates in this mechanism.Altogether, our findings show a link between the host degradation pathway and stabilization of modified viral small RNAs. Clearly, not all the small RNAs identified by our deep sequencing approach correspond to RNase L downstream products. Nonetheless, the fact that at least some of these small RNAs are protected and detected might implicate them in signaling events, maybe upstream of the infection front, which might prove difficult to assess in cell culture. We hypothesized that by removing RNase L we might uncover signatures corresponding to other types of small RNAs, such as siRNAs or piRNAs, but it did not turn out to be the case. This could be due to the fact that other enzymes might also be involved in the production of RNA fragments and is an indication that it will make the detection of antiviral RNAi complicated in differentiated mammalian cells. An alternate hypothesis could also be that SINV encodes an RNA silencing suppressor that blocks Dicer activity but has no effect on RNase L. Finally, it is also possible that the antiviral RNAi response might be detected only in specific subtypes of cells in mammals, which would be different from the differentiated somatic cells we used for our study. Further investigation will be needed to answer these questions and to decipher the roles played by this type of virusderived small RNAs, as well as their potential implication in the design of new antiviral therapeutic strategies.\\n\\nViral stocks, cell culture, and virus infection.\\n\\nPlasmid carrying wild-type (WT) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SINV genomic sequence (kindly provided by M. C. Saleh) was linearized with XhoI and used as a substrate for in vitro transcription using mMESSAGE mMACHINE capped RNA transcription kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sindbis viral stock was prepared in BHK21 hamster kidney cells, and titers were measured by plaque assay. HEK293 and Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Clontech) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37°C. Cells were infected with SINV at an MOI of 0.01. Samples were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h postinfection (hpi).RNAi-mediated protein depletion. For siRNA transfection, 0.4 ϫ 10 5 HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Transfections were carried out for 72 h using 20 nM ON-TARGET plus Smart Pool siRNAs (Dharmacon) for one-step depletion (human RNase L and Xrn1) or 100 nM ON-TARGET plus Smart Pool siRNAs (Dharmacon) for two-step depletion (human Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The ON-TARGET plus Nontargeting Pool siRNAs (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Cells were infected with SINV and harvested after 16 h for RNA and protein analysis.Small RNA cloning and sequencing. RNA was extracted from noninfected and SINV-infected HEK293 and Vero cells 16 hpi. Small RNA cloning was conducted with 10 or 20 g of total RNA as previously described (14, 29) . Small RNA libraries from SINV-infected HEK293 cells treated with control or RNase L-specific siRNAs were generated following the same protocol with some modifications. Mainly, small RNAs were ligated using degenerate 5= and 3= adapters to limit biases in the ligation step (56) . This procedure was also used to prepare small RNA libraries after NaIO 4 treatment of 100 g of total RNA, as previously described (57) , except that the 3= ligation was performed at 16°C overnight, in 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) to favor the cloning of modified small RNAs. Sequencing was performed at the IGBMC Microarray and Sequencing platform, Illkirch, France, using different Illumina instruments (Genome Analyzer IIx, HiSeq 2000, and HiSeq 2500) with a read length of 36 or 50 bp.A detailed description of the deep sequencing data analysis is available in Text S1 in the supplemental material.Microarray data accession number.
